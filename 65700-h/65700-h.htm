<p>The following Report contains a summary of investigations
of the Committee re-appointed by the British Association for
the Advancement of Science, at Montreal, Canada, in 1884, to
consist of Professor Newton, Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown, Mr. John
Cordeaux, Mr. W. Eagle Clarke, Mr. R. M. Barrington, and
Mr. A. G. More, for the purpose of obtaining (with the
consent of the Master and Elder Brethren of the Trinity
House, the Commissioners of Northern Lights, and the Commissioners
of Irish Lights) observations on the Migration of
Birds at Lighthouses and Lightships, and of reporting on the
same at Aberdeen in 1885. Mr. Cordeaux to be the Secretary.</p>

<p>The returns relating to Scotland have been arranged by
Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown; for the East Coast of England,
by Mr. Cordeaux; for the West Coast of England, by Mr. W.
Eagle Clarke; and those for the Coasts of Ireland, by Mr. R. M.
Barrington, Mr. A. G. More, and Mr. Eagle Clarke.</p>

<p>Having obtained an additional grant from the British
Association, we venture this year to add a new feature to our
Report in the form of a sketch-map, showing all the stations in
red. We have done this at the intelligent request of several of
our reporters; and the map has been executed for us by Messrs.
Macfarlane &amp; Erskine, of St. James' Square, Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Messrs. Gray and Anderson, I have some
interesting items of migration to record, taken by the latter
gentleman on board the steamship 'Marathon' in the Atlantic.
These are best given <i>in extenso</i>; and land-notes will be given
after the paragraphs on each species or group.</p>


<p class="tdc pmt2"><i>Steamship 'Marathon,' outward bound from Liverpool,
April 16th, 1884.</i></p>

<p>April 17th.&mdash;A small bird came on board at 7 p.m., 15 miles
from nearest land. (Position of ship at noon, Queenstown).
Wind easterly for ten hours previous, and was increasing to
moderate gale from E.N.E. when the bird was seen. From the
description of this bird it can scarcely have been other than a
Whinchat or Stonechat. No Petrels.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The lat. and long, give the ship's position at noon each day.</p>

<p>April 18th.&mdash;At 7 p.m., another, precisely the same species as
yesterday's, 310 miles from land; not caught. Eight Kittiwakes
and four Manx Shearwaters. Wind light E. all day. (Position
of ship at noon, lat. 51&deg; N., long. 15&deg; 47&#8242; W.). No Petrels.</p>

<p>April 19th.&mdash;Two Kittiwakes all day, till 580 miles from land.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">- 2 -</span>
Little Auks<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (?) seen frequently in parties of two to eight all day.
Two Shearwaters, 600 miles from land. Lat. 60&deg; 1&#8242;, long. 22&deg; W.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Called "Little Puffins," size of Water Ouzel, in notes.</p>

<p>April 20th.&mdash;At 8 a.m., one Manx Shearwater, 770 miles out.
Several pairs of little Auks during forenoon. At 5 p.m., two
Black-backed Common Shearwaters, 870 miles from land, outward
bound. No Petrels.</p>

<p>April 21st.&mdash;At 7 a.m., two Common Shearwaters, 1090

miles out. Lat. 46&deg; 37&#8242;, long. 36&deg; 18&#8242;; calm. (<i>Note.</i>&mdash;Previous
to this date the note was appended to each day's entry, "No
Petrels.")</p>

<p>April 22nd.&mdash;At 8 a.m., one Wilson's Petrel (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Oceanites
oceanicus</i>, Kuhl.), 1400 miles out from Fastnet; and one at
4 p.m., 1500 miles. At 7 p.m., two large Puffins<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> flying south.

</div>

<p>April 23rd.&mdash;At 11 a.m., two black-looking birds, like Gulls
(? Skuas) flying rapidly to N.E. During the day saw several
specimens of the large sea-bird usually seen on the banks (of
which we are now within sixty miles). [Probably from description
the immature of some species of large Gull.&mdash;J. A. H. B.].
Numerous small parties of two or three of the Little Auk, and
two large Puffins. From 6 to 7 p.m., saw numerous parties of
ten to twelve of some kind of (apparently) Plover, flying south.
No Petrels. Lat. 42&deg; 28&#8242;, long. 43&deg; 39&#8242;; wind light N.E.</p>

<p class="tdc pmt2"><i>Return Voyage of Steamship 'Marathon' from Boston, May 3rd.</i></p>

<p>May 3rd.&mdash;At 11 a.m., when 220 miles from Boston, one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">- 3 -</span>
Common Swallow (by description a Martin.&mdash;J. A. H. B.) going
west(!). Eight Black-footed Petrels; one Solan Goose, immature;
numerous Gulls. At 6 a.m., apparently the same Solan Goose,
twelve Wilson's Petrels, numerous Gulls, five Puffins, and two
Little Auks. Lat. 42&deg; 16&#8242;, long. 65&deg; 58&#8242;; wind light W.</p>

<p>May 5th.&mdash;At 8.30 a.m., one Skua. Thirty to forty Wilson's
Petrels all day. At 6 p.m., a couple of Gulls, and some Puffins.
Lat. 42&deg; 10&#8242;, long. 59&deg; 56&#8242;; wind light to mod. W.</p>

<p>May 6th.&mdash;From 8 a.m. till dark, thirty Wilson's Petrels,
two Little Auks, and one Gull. Lat. 42&deg; 04&#8242;, long. 53&deg;; wind
mod. N.W.</p>

<p>May 7th.&mdash;All day, twenty Wilson's Petrels, and four Manx
Shearwaters. Lat. 42&deg; 56&#8242;, long. 46&deg; 46&#8242;; wind fresh N.W.</p>

<p>May 8th.&mdash;At 8 a.m., one Black-footed Petrel (Fork-tailed
Petrel probably, Wilson's being yellow-webbed between the toes&mdash;J. A. H. B.).
Wind strong N.</p>

<p>May 9th.&mdash;At 8 a.m., five Terns flying N. At 8.30, twelve
Terns resting on sea ahead, flew north. At 5 p.m., seven or
eight Wilson's Petrels flying north, very tired-looking, and never
heeded the ship. One "Black-footed Petrel" flying N. Lat.
47&deg; 29&#8242;, long. 36&deg; 09&#8242;; wind strong N.</p>

<p>May 10th.&mdash;Very numerous parties of Terns all day, flying
north, three to twelve in number. At 9 a.m., one Skua, one
Black-footed Petrel, and one Kittiwake. Lat. 49&deg; 12&#8242;, long.

<p>May 11th.&mdash;At 8 a.m., several parties of Terns, and three
Skuas, all going north. At 8.30 a.m., one Kittiwake. At 5 p.m.,
three Kittiwakes. At 7 p.m., three Skuas circling about. No
Petrels. Lat. 50&deg; 81&#8242;, long, 23&deg; 19&#8242;; wind mod. N.</p>

<p>May 12th.&mdash;At 8 a.m., sixteen Kittiwakes, 10 Wilson's
Petrels, and four Manx Shearwaters. At 6 p.m., three Skuas,
and two very dark hawk-looking birds, evidently in company,
one very dark and the other had white vest and throat (Mr.
Anderson's "Skuas" are probably Pomatorhine Skuas, and these
last Richardson's Skuas.&mdash;J. A. H. B.). At 6.30 a flock of eighty
or ninety Terns flying high and going N. and W., and circling
frequently as if in doubt as to the proper course. They
approached the ship from N.E., and were lost to sight astern,
still undecided. One Puffin.</p>

<p>May 13th.&mdash;At 8 a.m., one (by description) Richardson's Skua
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">- 4 -</span>
flew past, seaward, ten miles from Queenstown, at noon. No
Petrels.</p>

<p>May 14th.&mdash;Only Gulls and Puffins.</p>

<p>The 'Marathon' is again advertised to sail for Boston on
June 18th.</p>

<p>At a later date Mr. Anderson sends a note on Solan Geese:&mdash;"On
Jan. 20th we passed numerous Solan Geese at Cape St.
Vincent. They could not fly, and many had a hard job to
flutter off on the surface sufficiently far to clear the ship. I saw
one black one. The others were mostly white, with yellowish
heads and greyish beaks. They all had the appearance of being
fully fledged. One Robin stayed a day on board between Naples
and Burriana, in Spain."</p>

<p>We suspect the regular appearance of Solans so far to the
southward will turn out to be closely associated with the
migrations of fish, possibly pilchards; and that, gorged with
these fish, they were unable to rise off the water, this difficulty not
arising from any state of moult in the bird's plumage.&mdash;J. A. H. B.</p>

<p>Thanks also to Mr. Spearman Swinburne, of Union Steamship
'Athenian,' I have several good schedules returned from
two voyages&mdash;one in spring, between April 5th and 29th; and
the second between Aug. 24th and Oct. 4th.</p>

<p>April 5th.&mdash;One Robin, one Yellowhammer, a flock of Jackdaws,
three Lapwings, and one Crested Lark (<i>A. cristata</i>),
between 7 a.m. and 2 p.m.; strong S.S.E.; v. c. r. The Robin
alighted, so did the Yellowhammer. The Jackdaws were flying
to eastward. The Lapwings followed the ship, and the Crested
Lark alighted on board. The Robin and Yellowhammer were
seen in lat. 53&deg; N., long. 9&deg; E.; the others in lat. 54&deg; N., long.
10&deg; E.</p>

<p>April 12th.&mdash;Seven Red-throated Divers, flying E.; one lot
of three, the rest singly, all with white throats; 6 to 7 a.m.;
light N.W., clear; off Schelling light-vessel.</p>

<p>April 20th.&mdash;One Wheatear, 2 p.m. till dark; light N.E., v. c.;
alighted on board. Lat. 46&deg; N., long. 8&deg; W.</p>

<p>April 22nd.&mdash;Bulwer's Petrels, throughout the morning;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">- 5 -</span>
W., strong, v. c.; about nine or ten in all flying singly, generally
against the wind. Lat. 34&deg; N., long. 16&deg; W. Also one "white-breasted"
Petrel, at 7 a.m., same lat. and long., fluttering on
surface. One Black Tern (in full black plumage); and on April
29th, Sooty Terns and Common Terns; a large flock at 9 a.m.,
wind light S., including with these species a dark species of
Gull.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Lat. 1&deg; S., long. 13&deg; W.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Oct. 19th, off Cape Point (Cape of Good Hope).
Passed through numbers of Great Shearwaters, and continued
seeing them up to Algoa Bay. This is the first time I have seen
them on this coast, and they are not included among the birds of
S. Africa. On our return, on November 2nd, we passed smaller
numbers of them, chiefly flying to the S.W. Nov. 16th, off
Bejouga Islands, observed a Skua in uniform brown plumage
chasing two grey and white birds, apparently some kind of
pigeon. While one bird was being attacked, the other would
rise in the air and attack the Skua in turn, and this continued
till I lost sight of them. The same day, at 1 p.m., saw what
looked like land; on approach turned out to be enormous flocks
of sea-birds feeding and moving to the N.E. Those we saw
afterwards were nearly all Greater Shearwaters.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mr. T. Southwell, of Norwich, I have the following
returns from the Polar Seas:&mdash;</p>


<p class="tdc pmt2"><i>Voyage of Steamship 'Eclipse' in Polar Seas, from the Log of
Capt. David Gray.</i></p>

<p>The 'Eclipse' left Peterhead on Feb. 28th, 1884, and Lerwick
on March 12th. On that day Bottlenose Whales were seen
hurrying northward, as well as a few "Mallemauks." Lat. at
noon 60&deg; 25&#8242; N., long. 0&deg; 41&#8242; W.; wind true S.; force 4<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; temp,
of air 42&deg;, of sea 44&deg;. At 8 p.m., temp, of water 47&deg;.</p>

<p>March 14th.&mdash;Lat. at noon, 66&deg; 4&#8242; N., d. r., long. 3&deg; 50&#8242; W.,
d. r. South. Force 9. Temp, of air 42&deg;, of water 40&deg;. Numbers
of "Mallemauks," and one or two "Looms."</p>

<p>March 17th.&mdash;Noon. Lat. 72&deg; 23&#8242; N. d. r., long. 5&deg; 44&#8242; W.
d. r. E. &frac12; N. Force 5. Temp, of air 25&deg;, of water 29&deg;. Made
the ice at 11.30 a.m. Slight sludge. Saw several "Snow Birds"
(Ivory Gulls), as well as a flock or two of "Rotges" (Little
Auks).</p>

force 5; temp, of air 36&deg;, of water 29&middot;5&deg;. We passed through the
sealing grounds (where on the 4th to 7th the young brood of seals
had been killed). Many crangs [skinless bodies of the young
seals] covered with snow were still visible, and around them
flocked myriads of "Snow-birds" and "Burgomasters."</p>

<p>April 26th.&mdash;Noon. Lat. 73&deg; 25&#8242; N., long. 5&deg; 6&#8242; E.; N.N.W.;

Eider Ducks going N.E.; and "Mallemauks" numerous.</p>

<p>April 27th.&mdash;Noon. Lat. 74&deg; 15&#8242; N., 4&deg; 30 E.; W.N.W.;
force 4; temp, of air, 17&middot;5&deg;, of water 29&deg;; at the pack-edge.
Several "schools" of old Saddle-back Seals seen going N.E.;
and "Rotges," "Looms," and "Dovekies" also on their northward
journey.</p>

<p>May 3rd.&mdash;Noon. Lat. 78&deg; 36&#8242; N., long. 1&deg; 13&#8242; E.; N.E. by

force 3; temp, of air 24&deg;, of water 30&middot;5&deg;; among floes. At five
o'clock got into a large water surrounded with floes. A few
"Unicorns" were sporting about in the still water; flocks of
"Rotchies" and "Looms" were flying hither and thither, and
some were swimming about engaged in diving for "whales'-food,"
upon which they subsist. A bear or two seen on the floe.</p>

<p>May 12th.&mdash;Noon. Lat. 78&deg; 47&#8242; N., long. 2&deg; 41&#8242; E.; N.N.W.;
force 2; temp, of air 18&deg;, of water 29&deg;; among floes. Got into
the land-water of Spitzbergen. Saw many "Mallemauks."</p>

<p>May 15th.&mdash;Noon. Lat. 79&deg; 20&#8242; N., long. 2&deg; 55&#8242; E.; S.E.;
force 3; temp, of air 26&middot;5&deg;, of water 29&middot;5&deg;; at pack-edge. A few
"Unicorns" seen; and a Hawk came on board, apparently dying
of hunger.</p>

<p>May 16th.&mdash;The Hawk seemed to be recovering, but on May
17th fell overboard and was drowned.</p>

<p>May 27th.&mdash;Noon. Lat. 77&deg; 40&#8242; N., long. 3&deg; 20&#8242; E.; S. &frac12; W.;
force 6; temp, of air 27&deg;, of water 31&deg; The water is very rich
with "whales' food"; "Unicorns" are numerous, and birds in
thousands.</p>

of water 31&deg;. "Whales' food" abundant, and birds numerous.
A few "Unicorns" seen, and one bear.</p>

<p>June 7th.&mdash;Noon. Lat. 77&deg; 57&#8242; N., 4&deg; 52&#8242; W.; N.W. &frac12; W.;
force 1; temp, of air 36&deg;, of water 33&middot;5&deg;; floes and loose ice.
Narwhals have been numerous; also birds, chiefly "Rotchies";
and one or two bears.</p>

<p>June 10th.&mdash;Noon. Lat. 78&deg; 3&#8242; N., long. 0&deg; 24&#8242;. W.; S.W. by

<p>Mr. John S. Alston writes under date of November 4th, 1884,&mdash;a
date as will be noted correlating with date of a great rush on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">- 9 -</span>
our E. Coast of Britain (J. A. H. B.),&mdash;as follows:&mdash;"We hope to
make Port Said to-morrow, after a very fair run all the way from
home. During the last three days we have been visited by more
little birds than I ever saw before at sea. So far as I can judge,
they were mostly Finches; but we saw two Quails and, of all
birds in the world, a Robin-redbreast, who most characteristically
seemed quite at home; and when he was frightened by a Hawk,
which was in close pursuit of this flock of birds, Robin quietly
hopped down the 'companion' into the engineers' quarters. I
had seen another Robin off Tarifa, the southern point of Europe,
but I was much struck to see this little fellow come on board
flying due south, the nearest land being Cape Matapan, hundreds
of miles away. Of course he may have been blown off shore by
a northerly gale, but when we met him he was flying against a
southerly breeze. The Hawk followed these birds, hovering
about the ship all day, but took his departure in the night. He
was a small one&mdash;a Merlin, I think."&mdash;(Signed) <span class="smcap">John S. Alston</span>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EAST_COAST_OF_SCOTLAND">EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND.</h2>
</div>


<p>The usual schedules were distributed to thirty stations on
the East Coast of Scotland, Faroe, and Iceland. Twelve stations
on East Coast of Scotland have sent in forty-one schedules out
of the twenty-eight stations, including Faroe and Iceland.</p>

<p>From the Isle of May we have, as usual, the heaviest
returns&mdash;fourteen schedules in all. Pentland Skerries again
comes second with twelve schedules, and Bell Rock is the
next in weight of returns.</p>

<p>In the following List of Stations, we indicate in Arabic type
the number of years in which each station has returned records,
and the consecutive numbers of the stations, as these coincide
with those on the map. Hitherto we have indicated by asterisks,
under each year as a heading, these particulars of returns, but
after the fifth year these become cumbrous, occupying too much
room. This year's returns, however, will again be indicated by
asterisks. As will be seen below in an analysis of the returns for
the past six years (see <a href="#General_Remarks2">General Remarks</a> end of W. C. of Scotland),
the character of the lights at each station appears to have considerable
influence on the bulking of records, the <i>white-fixed-lights</i>
having the largest as a rule. We mark in the list of
stations therefore their different values as migration stations.
The numerals indicate the true <i>migration values</i>, though the class
of light may not <i>always</i> correspond; and it remains to be seen
if their character be kept up in the future. These are indicated
by the following Roman numerals:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First Class.&mdash;I., usually <i>fixed white lights</i>, but may be
otherwise, if the situation is particularly favourable, as in
the case of Bell Rock (see below).</p>

<p>Second Class.&mdash;II., usually white-revolving, also intermittent.</p>

<p>Third Class.&mdash;III., white and red revolving</p>

<p>Fourth Class.&mdash;IV., white flash, and red and white sectors.</p>

<p>Fifth Class.&mdash;V., bad situation, or exposure, combined with other
disadvantages; <i>red fixed</i>; landlocked. All considerations bad.</p>

<p class="tdc pmt2"><i>Diary from the Stations.</i></p>

<p><i>N. Unst.</i>&mdash;Mr. James Edgar&mdash;formerly at Butt of Lewis&mdash;has
sent useful schedules embracing from Feb. 15th to 21st Sep.
and to Nov. 28th. "We have plenty of Ravens and Hooded
Crows all the year, therefore I only notice uncommon flocks."
"One pair of Hoodies, which has been about the rock for years,
attends regularly at dinner time (1 p.m.) to eat up scraps.
Their right is sometimes disputed by a half-tame Sea Gull. I
had a good opportunity of examining 'Jenny Wren' this
season. She remained for a fortnight."&mdash;<i>In lit.</i></p>

<p><i>Sumburgh Head.</i>&mdash;The old natives say they never before have
seen such vast numbers of Gulls as during this year, around
this station all the season onward from 8th March, 1884.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Mr. D. M. Scott has removed to Lamlash, Arran, since the date of his
last schedule, Sept. 15th, 1884, and is succeeded by Mr. Youngclause from
Monach Islands. Mr. Youngclause sends a light schedule from Sept. 19th
to Nov. 16th, of interest in showing the northerly extension of the migration
of Linnets and Turdid&aelig; (see <a href="#Gulls1">General Remarks</a> under Gulls).</p>

</div>

<p><i>N. Ronaldshay.</i>&mdash;Mr. John Tulloch sent one schedule
embracing the whole season from July 5th to Sept. 21st. I did
not receive this till the first week in March. In future I would
always like to have schedules returned immediately after last
day of January, or as soon as possible after that date, as it is more
difficult to work in stray schedules after the Report is written out.</p>

<p><i>Pentland Skerries.</i>&mdash;Mr. J. Gilmour was called away from
August 13th till Sept. 1st on a Board of Trade inquiry.
During that interval a Solan Goose struck the Lantern Dome,
and was found, but not killed ("this is very unusual"). A few
Wheatears and one Goldcrest were seen also, during this interval.
Gulls (a pair) bred on the island&mdash;a very unusual circumstance.</p>

<p>Easterly and southerly winds prevailed from March 10th to
April 12th, with occasional S.W., varying to N.; 12th to 19th,
N.E., fresh; 19th to May 4th, again S.E. and E., and N. on
latter date, and so on till August with very slight variations, or
light, variable.</p>

<p>In autumn, winds continued to prevail easterly, till about the
20th Sept., when they changed to westerly and northerly, and
this appeared to be characteristic along the whole E. coast,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">- 13 -</span>
thus making a visit paid by me to Isle of May, for three weeks in
September and October, rather unproductive of visible migration.
This N. &amp; W. prevalence caused migration to be much dispersed,
and no great rushes are recorded at Pentland Skerries or other
stations. But on the 14th Oct., during mod. E., after N.N.E.
and N.W. gales, a rush of Thrushes and Woodcocks will be found
recorded. Between Oct. 17th and Nov. 7th winds very variable
round three-fourths of compass, but almost never entering the
fourth quarter between S. and E.&mdash;indeed only on three days.
Strong N.E., weather cloudy and clear, very little haze. This
continued till Nov. 30th, except on Nov. 11 a S. gale, on 8th
S.W. gale, and on 20th a N. gale.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Read the above in connection with General Remarks.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Dunnet Head</i> gives a light return. The daily to-and-fro
migration of Gannets is spoken of in <i>general terms</i>, and the
dates of arrival and departure of rock birds were "about the
same dates as stated in last year's report."</p>

<p><i>Cromarty.</i>&mdash;The prevailing wind at this land-locked station
at the times of records, given between March 24th and
Dec. 26th, were from W. and S.W. Dates of arrivals in spring
and departures in autumn given. As before remarked, such
land-locked stations give abnormal returns as compared with
freely exposed stations, and the S.W. or W. winds were local.</p>

<p><i>Chanonry.</i>&mdash;Practically blank as regards actual migration, all
movements being local, Mr. J. McGill finding Scarts and
Cormorants flying up and down the Firth, Wild Ducks feeding
in frosty weather, and many Larks on Jan. 17th, 1884. Local
movements of Green Plover in November and December. No
certain migration discernible.</p>

<p><i>Kinnaird Head</i> returns a blank schedule, with the positive
statement "No birds." I am obliged to the head lighthouse-keeper
for returning this schedule. Such if regularly returned
would enable me to give always, year by year, a positive statement
of negative value. I wish others on the Aberdeenshire coast would
follow his good example.</p>

<p><i>Girdleness.</i>&mdash;A light return during November 14th to 17th
and December 1st to 12th. "Birds at this lighthouse very
scarce, the situation being very exposed." A record of a Fork-tailed
Petrel (seen by me on 15th August, J. A. H. B.) is of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">- 14 -</span>
considerable interest. Dead calm and hazy; on E. side of
lantern; about 12 p.m. Stomach contained only an oily matter
(Geo. Sim) <i>vide</i> Proc. Ryl. Phyl. Soc. Edin. 1884.
Bell Rock sends excellent schedules as usual. The early
advent of a swallow&mdash;March 13th and 14th&mdash;is commented
upon by letter. "It seemed much exhausted." Mr. Hutton,
Bank Manager, Royal Bank, Arbroath&mdash;a gentleman much
interested in ornithology&mdash;gave a full account of the occurrence
in the 'Dundee Advertiser' of April.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> "About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th and 14th March the
light-keeper on duty at the Bell Rock Lighthouse observed a swallow
fluttering in front of the kitchen window. After watching it for some little
time he opened the window and stood aside to see if the bird would come in.
This in a minute or two it did, and alighted on the inside of the windowsill.
So exhausted did the little wanderer appear from its long flight and
the buffetting of the weather that it allowed itself to be lifted up and put
into a cage. It immediately lay down on the bottom of the cage and
instantly fell fast asleep, remaining in this state till next morning about
eight o'clock (sixteen hours). So sound were its slumbers that the keepers
watching it as it lay could scarcely detect any signs of life in it, and at times
they were almost certain that it had died. On awakening at the hour
mentioned the swallow was taken out by one of the keepers and given a
drink of water. It was put back into the cage again, where it lay in an
apparently dormant condition till 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, when it was supplied with more
water, under the influence of which and the rays of the sun it became
quite lively and strong. The kitchen window was now lifted up and the
bird taken out and laid on the open hand of Mr. Jack, principal light-keeper.
Resting there for a moment, it gave one cheery twitter, and,
springing upwards from the outstretched palm, it winged its way in the
direction of the land and was lost sight of in the space of a minute or two.
The appearance of the bird so far north at such an early season is
remarkable. The swallow migrates to Africa at the end of October, and
it is not till the middle of April that the flight northward begins, so that
the one which surprised the light-keepers before March was half run was
several weeks earlier than the usual time for their appearance here. It
may be added that, the Swallow being an insectivorous bird, the lighthouse
keepers were unable to supply it with its ordinary food, and
abstained from giving it any other for fear of injuring it."</p>

</div>

<p>Between April 9th and Sept. 3rd scarcely any migration was
observed at Bell Rock&mdash;only four records in that time on
April 28th, April 30th, May 7th and 9th. But before and after
these dates in spring and autumn, considerable migration is
recorded in comparison, but decidedly slack, as compared with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">- 15 -</span>
other seasons, in autumn, owing to northerly and westerly
winds. This, however, was followed by a great rush in November,
for particulars of which the reader is referred to the details
under Species. The marvellous congregations of Gulls and their
prey the Sprat or Garvie (<i>Clupea sprattus</i>) are commented upon.
(<a href="#General_Remarks2">General Remarks</a>).</p>

<p><i>Isle of May.</i>&mdash;In January, 1884, intermittent migration
continued. The great gale of 27th to 29th produced nothing of
any consequence&mdash;one Yellowhammer, however, being the first of
the species seen for some time.</p>

<p>While rushes took place in spring at Bell Rock in March,
with the wind prevailing E., at Isle of May much smaller movements
are recorded, local winds apparently being more S. &amp; W.
(See especially "Thrushes," but the remark applies to other
species also.) This is curious at two stations so close to one
another. Bush of land birds in April. Movements of Guillemots
and rock birds somewhat different (see details). Partial
albino of the Willow Warbler captured (seen by me, J. A. H. B.)
Long spell of E. winds in April and rushes; but a light S.W.
wind on 30th, changing from S.S.E., brought a "wonderful
rush of land birds." This seems to me interesting, as proving
the station to lie in the direct route of migration, rushes occurring
both in the most favourable winds&mdash;S.E. or E. (<i>i.e.</i> for
spring migration), and those supposed to lie less favourable, and
following winds, <i>viz.</i> S.W.</p>

<p>A later schedule&mdash;April 30th to June 3rd&mdash;shows evidences
of a decidedly late spring migration, for which it seems difficult
to assign a cause. This was also noticeable on land. It took
place in second week of May, with light S.W. and W. wind,
mist, fog, and rain; principally of Warblers and insect-feeding
species.</p>

<p>Very few records are given between June 11th and August.
A usual return of Warblers, &amp;c., noted as rather early by
August 10th. Bush of same species, 19th and 24th. In end of
August and all September, on till about October 18th, winds
retarded migration, being N. and W.; never, or very rarely,
S. and E., or S. of W. I spent three weeks and three days on
Isle of May, between September 24th and October 17th, and
during that time only witnessed intermittent and slack migration;
the only attempt at a night rush apparent being on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">- 16 -</span>
night of October 4th, at the time of total eclipse of the
moon&mdash;wind Light W. at the time&mdash;some twelve Goldcrests
being caught at the lantern.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> A male Black Redstart was
shot on October 24th, and a second seen on 25th. The
principal rush of the year on November 4th instances the effect
of a sudden change of wind. This must have been a very vast
and determined rush, as many came also with a W. wind
afterwards. This rush was composed principally of Finches
and Larks, with considerable numbers of Turdid&aelig;; but the
great rush of the latter (Thrushes) did not take place till the
rush of the Finches was past. Whilst the Finches and Larks
greatest rush was on Nov. 4th, the greatest rush of Thrushes,
Blackbirds, and Turdid&aelig; generally was on 12th to 16th. (For
particulars see details under Species).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Our Isle of May notes containing a few items of interest will be used in
a separate paper on that island, but actual results will be worked into this
report also.</p>

</div>

<p>Thereafter migration continued with less force up to Jan.,
1885, the date of the last schedule to hand.</p>

<p><i>Inchkeith.</i>&mdash;This land-locked station returns a light
schedule&mdash;of considerable interest, however, as carrying out
what has been remarked by us in previous reports, that when
birds do occur here on migration it is usually with S.W. and
westerly winds, whether in spring or in autumn. The Siskin
seems to frequent Inchkeith as a regular migrant, and
Titmice are also regular in appearance.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Separate Report under Genera and Species.</span></p>

<p id="Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, migration at Sumburgh Head (April
only, large flocks of Common Thrushes on 1st, wind light S.E.,
clear, along with Starlings and Linnets), and Pentland Skerries
(indication in March, and partial and remittent in April, but no
great rush evident). At Bell Rock (great rush recorded on 6th
and 8th March of Thrushes, Ring Ouzels, light S.E. wind), and
at I. of May, but rush not observable here on 6th and 8th, there
being only two records of Blackbirds and a few Redwings, owing
to local wind being light W. and haze. Earliest record at I. of
May, Feb. 20th, one Redwing with Blackbirds and Thrushes; a
rash, and latest records, also at I. of May, on 29th and 30th April,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">- 17 -</span>
along with Robins, Redstarts, &amp;c., with S.E., or light S.W., of
Ring Ouzels. Light records in March; on 9th and 10th twenty
Fieldfares&mdash;"a good number"&mdash;with light N.E., clear, and
N.N.E. and rain.</p>

<p>In autumn the migration was pronounced, and whilst
desultory movements continued during September and October,
the heaviest rushes are recorded in the middle of November.
Records of Dippers, one on Aug. 2nd and another (well described)
on Aug. 29th, at I. of May; wind light W., clear. The place
where they were observed was afterwards pointed out to me&mdash;<i>viz.</i>,
at the edge of a stagnant pool of water near the "Mill Door"
on the I. of May. Earliest record of Fieldfare, Sept. 10th, at
I. of May, light S., haze; latest of same species, on Dec. 31st,
and Jan. 19th, 1885, also at I. of May; variable, haze. Earliest
record of Common Thrush, also at I. of May, the day after,
<i>viz.</i> Sept. 11th, light S., haze; and latest, at I. of May also, on
Dec. 22nd, when "a few" were noticed. Earliest Missel Thrush
on Sept. 27th (seen by J. A. H. B.), also at I. of May, with gale,
W.S.W., and latest Oct. 14th; but others, no doubt, have escaped
special records, and have been confused with other species.
Earliest Redwings do not appear in the schedules till Oct. 2nd,
also at I. of May (J. A. H. B.); on 7th a few more, followed by
scattered records till Nov. 12th, when old and young struck in
numbers at Bell Rock, and the rush of this and of Fieldfares
took place on the 4th and 5th of November, continuing till the
17th, with Blackbirds, male and female, and intermittently until
December. Earliest Blackbirds Sept. 11th,&mdash;"not many,"&mdash;at
Isle of May.</p>

<p>Rush of Thrushes, Nov. 7th (light) at Pentland Skerries, and
Nov. 30th, at I. of May (considerable). Rush of Fieldfares and
Redwings (indicated) at N. Unst, on Nov. 5th, with a few Blackbirds,&mdash;all
flying S.,&mdash;indicated at Pentland Skerries, 5th, 7th,
to 12th, with Blackbirds and a few Thrushes and Woodcocks, on
12th. At Dunnet Head a few Blackbirds and Thrushes seen
daily between Oct. 1st and Nov. 13th. Rush of Ring Ouzels
("great numbers") at Bell Rock; and rush of Fieldfares and
Redwings at I. of May on 4th and 5th. At N. Ronaldshay also
a rush visible on the 8th, with Woodcock, Crows and Rooks;
Nov. 7th and 8th, wind E.S.E., a great rush. All during October
the above-named <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> appeared in small numbers, the wind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">- 18 -</span>
prevailing N. and W., and scarcely ever S. and E. Stations
sending returns of Thrushes are N. Unst, Pentland Skerries,
Dunnet Head, Bell Rock, and I. of May. At the dates of the
rushes they were accompanied by many other species. The rush
at I. of May on 4th and 5th continued in great force after the wind
shifted to S.E., with rain, after wind S. at noon, on 4th ("perfect
weather for witnessing migration"), so fewer Fieldfares again
on 5th, with wind&mdash;a W. gale, instancing the abruptness with
which migration ceased owing to changes in the wind. A vast
rush of Blackbirds, females predominating, on 12th, at I. of May,
with S. haze and drizzle, but ceased utterly with change of wind
to W. at 9 p.m. All birds striking on S.E. side, <i>with</i> the wind.
Along with this rush came large numbers of Redwings and Fieldfares,
Hooded Crows, one Yellow Bunting, large number of Larks,
Robins, Bramblings, Chaffinches, eight Hedgesparrows, a few
House Sparrows, two Woodcocks (shot). On the 15th Blackbirds
as numerous as ever, but fewer Redwings and Fieldfares;
hundreds of Snow Buntings, flying N. By the 17th Blackbirds
were mostly males, but females had predominated up to that date.
In January, 1885, between 4th and 21st, a few light records of
Fieldfares and Thrushes, and a large number (rush?) on latter
date. The rush on Nov. 4th consisted of Siskins and other
<i>Fringillid&aelig;</i> (these continuing in small numbers to the 6th, notwithstanding
the change of wind). Mr. Agnew describes this as
the largest rush of migrants this season at the I. of May, and it
must have been very vast, close, and determined, when even on
the 6th, with light W. wind, large numbers of Bramblings and
Chaffinches still appeared. Other species participating besides
the above were Siskins, Woodcocks (six killed), Rock Pipits, one
Owl, two Falcons. (See notes upon weather under "Notes under
Stations." We refer back to this account under other species,
to dates).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Wheatears in considerable numbers at Pentland
Skerries and Isle of May (a rush). Earliest at Isle of May
March 26th, light S., two; and a few more on 28th at same
station, including two old males. Rush with S.E. to S.W. wind
at Pentland Skerries, on April 6th, and considerable numbers at
I. of May on April 3rd. Beyond these there are no other spring
records of this species. On March 31st a single Black Redstart
(<i>in mus.</i> Feilden &amp; Harvie Brown) is recorded from Pentland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">- 19 -</span>
Skerries; light S.E., haze.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> We have also three single records
of the true Stonechat at I. of May, on 2nd, 28th and 30th April,
and one at Pentland Skerries on May 14th, light E. wind, struck
lantern, not killed. On April 30th a rush of Redstarts along
with Robins, Ring Ouzels, &amp;c., at Isle of May. This concludes
spring records.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> A full record of this rarity, and of previous occurrences in Scotland, is
given by me in Proc. Ryl. Phyl. Soc. Edin., read 23rd April, 1884; and a system
of Record Forms recommended for tabular and formal records of rarities in
future (see also Report for 1883, p. 81). We wish observers would recognise
the use of some such uniform method, and we are certain it would save much
time and trouble for future compilers.</p>

</div>

<p>In autumn records from N. Unst, one Redstart (the only one
seen this year) and one Wheatear, on 7th and 12th September
respectively; flew S.W. This is the earliest 1884 record of
<i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i> in autumn. Also from N. Ronaldshay, a number on
15th striking, and Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, and I. of May,
of Wheatears, a few Redstarts, Whinchats, &amp;c., and one Black
Redstart, old male, shot (<i>in mus.</i> I. of May, present curator
Mr. Joseph Agnew). Another was seen the following day&mdash;first
on 24th, second on 25th Oct. (recorded in full in Ryl. Phyl. Soc.
Proc. 1885, read 21st Jan., 1885); a Common Redstart seen at
same time.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The records of all the species are light, and no
rush, unless of Wheatears, <i>ut sup.</i>, Oct. 22nd, at Isle of May,
increasing by the 25th. During our stay on the island (27th
Sept. to 17th Oct.) we observed a good many straggling birds.
A few accompanied the rush of other species on Nov. 12th (see
<span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span>). One Whitethroat is returned from I. of May, striking
face of lantern, "facing the wind," on Sept. 12th. Mr. Agnew
has the note,&mdash;to date of the 19th of September,&mdash;"I am surprised
at so few birds with such thick fog." Log, light to
strong E., thick fog, or haze between the 12th and 19th, yet
migration was tardy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> All the previous records of this species in Scotland relate to localities
the position of which shows comparatively easily how they arrived at each.
These records now amount to six in all, of which I have recorded the last
three since Mr. Gray wrote his 'Birds of the West of Scotland.' They are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One: collection of Mr. Sinclair of Wick (R. Gray, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 84).</p>

<p>One: obtained at Cullen, Banff, by Mr. T. Edward (<i>ditto</i>).</p>

<p>One: Kirkwall, Orkney, 20th Dec, 1859 (R. Gray, <i>op. cit.</i>).</p>

<p>One: Higginsneuk, Stirlingshire, 10th Nov., 1875 (J. A. H. B., Proc. Ryl.
Phyl. Soc, vol. iv., p. 142).</p>

<p>One: Pentland Skerries (J. A. H. B., <i>op. cit.</i>).</p>

<p>One: Isle of May (as given above).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">- 20 -</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Cromarty, Robins disappeared March 24th.
We have then spring records from Sumburgh Head, Pentland
Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May, all in April. Earliest at
Sumburgh Head, April 1st, when four appeared, strong S.E.,
haze, but the remark is added, "First time Robins have stayed
all winter." Next records not till 28th, 29th, and 30th, at Bell
Rock, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May, where there was a
rush along with Ring Ouzels. The record at Bell Rock (28th)
is one of very few records between the 9th of April and the 3rd
of September.</p>

<p>In autumn, one return on Aug. 25th, as arriving at Cromarty,
light S.W., clear. No more till Nov. 3rd, when "a few" at Isle
of May. But next day a rush of other species (see under
<a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>). There were, however, a few Robins frequenting Isle
of May in September and October, and even the indication of a
rush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Only a slight indication in spring of Goldcrests'
migration, 2nd, 8th, 16th of April, single records at
N. Unst and Pentland Skerries. But of Warblers a rush at Isle
of May, along with Redshanks, and Robins and Ring Ouzels (see
<a href="#Turdidae">Thrushes</a>), and in May one Wood Warbler at Isle of May;
light S.W.</p>

<p>In autumn:&mdash;Goldcrest, earliest appearance at Isle of May,
Aug. 31st (a female), along with a Sedge Warbler, light W., haze;
then on Sept. 1st, one at Isle of May, and a few light records,
7th, 8th, 10th, 18th, and 27th. On 7th at N. Unst ("only the
second occurrence of it observed here"), and intermittent and
light till 4th Oct., when, during darkest time and total eclipse of
the moon, I assisted in capturing and identifying twelve Goldcrests
at I. of May lantern, about which I may have more to say
in the "<a href="#General_Remarks2">General Remarks</a>." Again, on the 24th, numbers were
seen, with light S. wind. Some Chiffchaffs seen at I. of May on
Sept. 11th, and one at lantern on 27th (seen by J. A. H. B.).
This constitutes all the important records of the species of

<p><span class="smcap">Titmice.</span>&mdash;The only spring records of "Titmice" are 12th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">- 21 -</span>
15th and 24th May, at Pentland Skerries, in different winds, <i>viz.</i>
light N.W., fresh S.W., and light S.E.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> We wish our reporters could distinguish the species more exactly. We
have six species of "Titmice" in Britain, and possibly seven on migration.
I want wings of Titmice obtained or whole birds.</p>

</div>

<p>In autumn slight movements in September and October; one
on Pentland Skerries on 5th Oct.; one "Titmouse" on I. of May
on 9th Sept., and on Oct. 4th at same station, an indication of
Titmice having joined in the migratory rush of that date, seven
appearing, with light W.S.W., wind and haze. On Oct. 9th we
shot a "Blue Tit" (<i>Parus c&aelig;ruleus</i>, L.) on I. of May, which had
been haunting the fields for two or three days; light W., clear.
First actual record of the species by name here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Accentorin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Isle of May a late rush
took place of Sedge Warblers between 9th and 13th May, along
with many other species, as follows:&mdash;Wood Warblers, Cuckoos,
Meadow Pipits, Whinchats (vera), Flycatchers (till 14th), Fieldfares.
Mr. Agnew remarks, "long of coming, and remaining
longer than usual." Hedge Accentors bred for the first time on
Isle of May, and I saw the old nest.</p>

<p>In autumn, earliest movement, a rush of Sedge Warblers,
10th August ("this is early"), with fresh S.E. wind and fog.
Up to 19th a desultory movement, but on latter date a rush of
Sedge Warblers, Whinchat, Wrens, Whitethroats (especially on
19th), Chiffchaffs, Starlings (q.v.). Hush again on 24th of small
birds&mdash;Whitethroats and Warblers. On 31st a single Sedge
Warbler killed. On Sept. 1st a number of Sedge Warblers, all
at I. of May, light W., clear; and on 4th a number of Accentors
(Hedgesparrows). In October several Accentors at I. of May on
27th, and a few of the same species on 6th and 7th November,
and along with the general rush on 12th (see <a href="#Turdidae">Thrushes</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Earliest record at Sumburgh Head on 22nd
March, when four appeared at 12 noon; light breezes, showery.
Also in April at same station, on 1st and 15th, six Wrens, with
S.E., fresh, and haze, and fresh N., clear, respectively. Also at
Pentland Skerries, on 1st April, one, and one on 12th, with, in
both cases, fresh to strong S.E., and at Bell Rock, on 2nd April,
one, strong S.E., haze, flying W., with a general rush of "small
birds" resting or flying W.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">- 22 -</span></p>

<p>In autumn, at N. Unst, Sumburgh Head, and Isle of May.
Earliest at Sumburgh Head, on 7th Sept., seven seen; 12th at
N. Unst, fine, one remained a week; and 17th, at I. of May, one.
In October, odd ones on 7th; at N. Unst and Pentland Skerries,
a number (almost a rush on I. of May, on 9th, and increased up
to 25th). In November one at N. Unst; strong N. wind.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
"Wrens" are also recorded, on Jan. 23rd, 1885, as still present
on Isle of May, probably having wintered there.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> I feel a little curious about these N. Unst Wrens, and would like to see
one or two.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;As early as Feb. 14th, at I. of May, a single
record of a "Wagtail" flying N.W., clear, fine. [The entry "Wagtail,"
we presume, in most cases is applied to the black and white
or Pied Wagtail.] On March 25th one "Wagtail" flying E. over
Pentland Skerries, light S., clear. At I. of May one on 9th March,
a few on 22nd, and "two males staying to breed" on 28th. On
April 1st two single records at Pentland Skerries, and at Isle of
May; wind at both places, fresh S.E., haze. In May, from 8th
to 25th, light records on eight days, four on the 10th (the most),
and "several" on the 11th (indication of a rush?). "Several"
again on the 12th. On the 16th one at Bell Rock, light E., and
on May 14th two Yellow Wagtails, light W. In July, on the
5th, one "Wagtail," moderate S.E., and one on 20th, light,
variable, clear.</p>

<p>In autumn, no records in August. Spasmodic movements in
September at N. Unst, few records, and these single. "Several"
at Pentland Skerries on 2nd, strong N.W., and ditto on 8th, light,
variable, clear, and on 23rd ditto, light N.W., showers. On 8th
and 9th at Isle of May, indication of a rush, adult and young,
increase on 9th over the 8th; light, variable, clear. Last record,
one on Oct. 9th at Isle of May.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pipits.</span>&mdash;The arrivals and movements of Rock Pipits (or
"Mosscheepers" or "Tang Sparrows") are reported only from
Bell Rock and I. of May in spring, in March and April; earliest
16th March at Bell Rock, latest 7th April; also at Bell Rock. At
Bell Rock four single records, 16th, 29th and 30th March, and
7th April, and at I. of May, on 28th March, "more Rock Pipits
arrived." At I. of May about twenty Meadow Pipits arrived on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">- 23 -</span>
the 13th of February, and a considerable rush&mdash;or at least
indication of a rush&mdash;began on the 1st April and increased on
the 3rd, and a further increase observable on the 23rd; winds S.
to E. and S.E.</p>

<p>In autumn I have no records till the 13th September, "large
numbers," at Isle of May, of Rock Pipits,&mdash;"a large increase on
those already there,"&mdash;and none again at same station till 14th
October, when a number arrived and "all except such as will
probably remain the winter" left on 16th. More again appeared
on the 25th, and still more on the 31st; and by the 4th of
November a rush, with other migrants. At Bell Rock only six
records of straggling birds between the 5th and 22nd. Rock
Pipits are also given as still on Isle of May on the 23rd January,
having wintered there as predicted. Of Meadow Pipits considerable
numbers, with light E. and fog, at Isle of May, on the
16th and 18th September, and a few more seen occasionally
up to the middle of October. No other records.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muscicapid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring a rush of Flycatchers noticed at
Isle of May on 4th May, but no other records given from any
other station. Considerable numbers were observed. No other
records of any species during the year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring I have a single record of a Swallow
(Swift?) as early as 12th March, which arrived much exhausted,
with strong S.E. wind and mist (see remarks under <a href="#Stations">Stations</a>,
<i>antea</i>). In April only two records of Sand Martin at N. Unst,
on 27th, and at Sumburgh Head on 10th, with light S.W. and
S., clear (marked as "not common").</p>

<p><i>Land Note.</i>&mdash;Allan Water, in Stirlingshire, 13th April, and
at Doune, same county, next day. Became numerous by May 3rd
at Bridge of Allan. Kelso 23rd and 28th March, and again on
April 10th (Dr. J. Grieve, <i>in lit.</i>).</p>

<p>In May, records from Sumburgh Head in the North, Pentland
Skerries, Cromarty, and I. of May. Earliest at the land-locked
station of Cromarty on 5th, light N. and showers; indication of a
rush apparently, about 11th or 12th, at the more northern
stations, and faint indications at I. of May (eight birds) on 12th,
with the remark "very few this year." On the 20th and 22nd also,
simultaneous appearance of a few at Sumburgh Head and Isle of
May&mdash;"Records in all, ten in May, at four stations, on six dates,
between the 5th and 22nd." This formula perhaps shows as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">- 24 -</span>
well as any method, the distribution and arrivals on our East
Coast.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> It may not have been apparent to the readers of our previous and this
Report that, in order to arrive at final conclusions, after our collection of
data is considered large enough, a certain amount of formal sameness and
method of recording has been followed by the Committee throughout. This
is for the final development of a system of easy tabulation at the end when
all our data, year with year, come to be compared and deductions drawn.
Our Irish members of Committee have departed somewhat from this plan of
work, but there seems no reason apparent why their results need not with
equal ease be made workable into the final form of reduction.</p>

</div>

<p>In summer, at I. of May one record of Swallow on 12th July,
variable, light, clear; and one record of Sand Martin at I. of May
on 18th July, fresh W. and clear. <i>Note.</i>&mdash;Summer records of
Swallows usually occur in clear weather; compare with previous
reports.</p>

<p>In autumn, in August two records at the more northerly
stations, <i>viz.</i> Pentland Skerries, on 11th Aug., six birds, with
fresh S., haze, and at Dunnet Head, on 16th of four birds flying
E., with S.E. and fog. In September, Swallows left Cromarty,
and were not seen after the 4th, at 1 p.m., wind light S.W., clear;
all congregated on a housetop near the Lighthouse, and left
suddenly at 1 o'clock. At Isle of May a few were observed on
two or three dates in October, and on the 28th (Sunday) twenty
were seen at 9 a.m. flying up and down the lee-side of the island
hawking for flies; light S.W., clear.</p>

<p><i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Without receiving any more returns from any
East-Coast station, I myself observed a Swallow (<i>Hirundo
rustica</i>) hawking persistently for flies over and across the lawn at
Glendoune House, near Girvan, Ayrshire, on Nov. 8th (see <a href="#WEST_COAST_OF_SCOTLAND">West
Coast Report</a>). At Rothesay, Mr. John Grieve saw none during
a stay there till 15th, when twenty or thirty were seen. None
seen by him at Bridge of Allan after his return there on the
1st October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fringillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;As in 1883, both in spring and autumn,
Finches show themselves well to the front in migration; but
while in some years Thrushes and Finches travel much together;
in this year, whilst still many travelled simultaneously, as a
glance at our data shows, yet the great rush of Thrushes did not
take place till the rush of Finches was over. Thus, as will be
seen, Green Linnets made a rush over in spring as early as 10th
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">- 25 -</span>
February, but the rush of Thrushes did not take place till later&mdash;about
the 6th March. In the same way, while the greatest
rush of Finches in autumn took place on the 4th November,
Thrushes were not in force till the 10th and 12th. The extension
of the migration of Finches in 1884, in time, dates Feb. 15th
(three Grey Linnets at Pentland Skerries at noon, wind strong
S.E. and clear) to Jan. 26th (four Green Linnets at Isle of May,
wind variable, light, clear). The extension of the migration of
Finches (of sorts) in 1884 in N. and S. direction, ranges from
Sumburgh Head,&mdash;a single record of great numbers on the 3rd
April, with strong S.E. and haze,&mdash;to Isle of May; earliest date
10th February, followed by rush on 12th; latest date Jan. 26th,
four Green Linnets. To compare with the above, the extension
in time of the Thrushes' migration dates also from Feb. 10th,
but movements were much fewer so early&mdash;a single Redwing and
a few Blackbirds and Thrushes, strong S.E., clear, up to 23rd
January; rush between 19th and 23rd of Fieldfares, &amp;c. The
extension in N. and S. distribution ranges from North Unst,&mdash;a
dozen Fieldfares flying S., light W., clear,&mdash;through Sumburgh
Head; large numbers; and a rush on 1st April, strong S.E., along
with Linnets, rushes at more southern stations taking place in
March, on till our southern stations of Isle of May and Bell
Rock are reached.</p>

<p>Now, taking the above general remarks, we will treat it more
in detail, as this affords a good opportunity of making final
tabular comparisons.</p>

<p>In spring, earliest at Pentland Skerries, three Grey Linnets
at noon, as already recorded, light S.E., clear; latest Green
Linnets (and latest Finches), 17th June, one at Isle of May.
An early rush of Green Linnets on 10th Feb., after a N.W. gale
previous night, and a great rush on 12th, with other migrants;
and of Thrushes, Bramblings, Chaffinches and House Sparrows,
at Isle of May. Intermittent movements during March at Pentland
Skerries and Isle of May and Inchkeith, flocks of Chaffinches,
Grey Linnets (25th), Bramblings, Green Linnets, and four
Siskins (at Inchkeith on 25th, with light S.W. wind, with which,
being a land-locked station, this species usually occurs), two
Bullfinches, at Bell Rock, on 31st March, flying W. In April
Chaffinches, Grey Linnets, and one Sparrow at Pentland Skerries,
between 5th and 22nd; wind prevailing S.E., except on 12th and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">- 26 -</span>
17th, when light N.E. At Bell Rock one House Sparrow (female),
exhausted, died after feeding on 31st. From the 9th April, when
one Bullfinch was seen (and one the day before), scarcely any
migration observed until Sept. 3rd&mdash;a few records only of "small
birds" on April 28th and 30th and May 7th and 9th. At Isle of
May a rush ("evidently") of many species, including Tree
Sparrows, Bramblings (males), Chaffinches (males, but some
females), from the 3rd, and during 4th, 5th and 6th, to 10th.
The female Chaffinches came on 6th to 10th, but mixed males
and females on the 10th. Tree Sparrows abundant. Rush tailing
off, with light returns, on 10th, 16th, 17th and 23rd to 30th. In
May Grey Linnets are reported to arrive, for the purpose of
breeding, at Isle of May on the 29th. Other records run rarely
of this species, and only a few intermittent records of birds flying
W. or N.W. at Pentland Skerries, and a single bird at Bell Rock
between 9th and 30th. One Sparrow (male) on 7th, and two on
9th, at Pentland Skerries; and two Bullfinches, flying W., with
strong E.S.E. and haze&mdash;the only other May records. In June
the last of the Tree Sparrows on 13th at Isle of May, strong S.E.,
completely ends the spring records, and we do not have another
of any Finches till Sept. 8th.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> The bulk of the autumn records will not admit of treatment <i>in extenso</i>,
as they are heavy, so we will cut them shorter than the spring ones.</p>

</div>

<p>In autumn, no records in July or August recorded. Very light
in September: two records of Grey Linnets on the 8th at Pentland
Skerries, and of Siskins at Inchkeith on 10th; latest on
Jan. 26th, four Green Linnets. Rushes (or indications) at Pentland
Skerries and Isle of May, between 4th and 7th, of several
species; Grey and Green Linnets, Bramblings, and an increase
of Chaffinches on 25th and 27th. A rush of Linnets (and Larks)
at Inchkeith on 23rd, with light S. breeze; "continuous flocks
all day flying round." Most northern records of Finches in
autumn at Sumburgh Head on 12th October. Great rush, 4th
November, with many other birds; wind S. and haze during the
night, S.E. in morning, and rain at 10 a.m. ("perfection of
weather for visible migration"). At 9 p.m., gale from S.W. and
heavy rain. Nevertheless, so persistent or so vast was this rush,
that, even with W. gales and showers, a few Chaffinches, Tree
Sparrows, House Sparrows, and Green Linnets were seen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">- 27 -</span>
migrating at Isle of May&mdash;the largest numerical rush of migrants
there this season; continued intermittently to end of December.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Large numbers on 12th December, flying N., light W., haze.
Mr. Agnew has the note, "Never saw so many Finches in one
year as this."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> Since the above was written out I have received the January schedule
from the Isle of May, and in it intermittent movements of Green Linnets
and Bramblings up to 26th&mdash;the latest date&mdash;are recorded.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In Spring, Rooks are recorded from Pentland
Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May. Earliest date, Pentland
Skerries 14th February, two seen on island, fresh S. Latest
also at Pentland Skerries on 14th May. Light S. No rushes
very apparent. Largest numbers, six on March 10th at Pentland
Skerries, and eight on April 19th at same station. Most records (on
different dates), in March six, and in April four. Fewest records
(on different dates) in February two, and in May two. Direction
of wind and weather on dates of record in February:&mdash;Fresh
S., on 14th, two birds seen on Pentland Skerries; Fresh S.
clear, on 23rd one seen at Pentland Skerries. In March, S.E.
gale, rain on 9th, two or three seen at Pentland Skerries; light
airs, variable, snow on 10th, six seen at Pentland Skerries;
calm, haze on 4th, one seen flying S.W. at Bell Rock; light
S.E. on 8th, one rested on dome of lantern. Fresh S. breeze on
13th, one seen flying W.S.W.; light W.S.W., haze, one flying
S.W. on 22nd. In April:&mdash;light S.E. on 3rd, one seen at
Pentland Skerries; light S.E. on 5th, four seen at Pentland
Skerries; fresh N.E. on 19th, when eight seen at Pentland
Skerries; N.E. light clear on 3rd at Bell Rock, one resting on
window. In May:&mdash;strong N. on 6th, at Pentland Skerries,
two seen; light S. on 14th, one seen at Pentland Skerries.</p>

<p>In July one record of Rooks at Pentland Skerries, fresh N.W.</p>

<p>In autumn, Rooks are recorded from N. Unst, Sumburgh
Head, Girdleness, but much scarcer than in spring. Earliest
date, 12th September, a pair, seen at N. Unst, flying S.W.,
and one on 19th at same place, also flying S. Latest,
December 4th, at Girdleness, "large flocks,"<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> rushes, none apparent,
unless any accompanied the rushes in October of Hooded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">- 28 -</span>
Crows, but none recorded as accompanying the latter. Only
records on two days in September, one day in November, and
one day in December.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> May only have been of local significance, but cannot say, as direction
of wind and flight is not given in schedule.</p>

</div>

<p>In Spring, Hooded Crows (<i>Corvus cornix</i>, L.) are reported
from Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May. Earliest,
February 23rd, at Pentland Skerries; latest, May 3rd at Pentland
Skerries. No great rush; less than usual. Mr. Agnew's
note at April 10th, "very few Hooded Crows this year." It is
difficult even to fix an indication of a rush. All the records of
Hooded Crows and Carrion Crows occur with either fresh S.
or light S.E., excerpt a few of the latter, with N.E. clear,
on April 15th. Of Carrion Crows, a slightly larger and more
compressed migration, beginning on 8th March with twelve
seen, ending 15th April; and an indication of a rush between
8th and 15th, flying N., recorded only from Bell Rock and Isle
of May.</p>

<p>In autumn, a more decided movement of Hooded Crows, with
a few Carrion Crows (the latter on October 24th to 26th), records
from Sumburgh Head, N. Ronaldshay, Pentland Skerries,
Girdleness, and Isle of May (none noted at Bell Rock).
Earliest, at N. Unst (most northerly station); on Nov. 7th one
got in court with broken wing, and at N. Ronaldshay on 8th,
numbers; strong S.W. Next earliest, on 11th at Pentland
Skerries, 3 seen. Mod. S., clear. Latest on December 4th at
Pentland Skerries, and at Girdleness on January 4th at
former, and Dec. 4th at latter (with large flocks of Rooks at
the latter). Decided rush between Oct. 11th and 26th at
Pentland Skerries (14th), Mod. E., and at Isle of May. The
numbers recorded are, on 11th and 12th one shot by J. A. H. B.;
no more till 23rd, eighteen flying N. (and Rooks), forty on 24th
and forty on 25th, with one Carrion Crow. Continued on 26th;
one lighted on lantern (rare). Again, in November; a number
for some days (along with Ravens, at Sumburgh Head on 10th);
also at Pentland Skerries a few, and the indication of a rush at
Isle of May, on the 12th to 15th, flocks of nine and twelve
having been seen on these dates.</p>

<p>Other species mentioned are Jackdaws, a few in February, at
Isle of May, stayed between 16th and 21st, and one seen on
25th. None anywhere in March, but resident from April 1st till
August 1st, when all left. Besides these, a few passing birds at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">- 29 -</span>
Pentland Skerries, on April 4th ("rare"), "fatigued," fresh
S.E., and two on 19th, fresh N.E. Three also on 22nd at Isle
of May, fresh S.E. haze, and in May at Pentland Skerries, one,
N.W., clear; resting on island. Jackdaws have one entry,
August 1st at Cromarty. The note is added "have all left."
In October, one Jackdaw again at Pentland Skerries (marked
again, "rare"), light W., rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ravens.</span>&mdash;One record on April 4th; three seen at Sumburgh
Head, probably resident at Fetlar, or in the vicinity. A number
are recorded on one date in autumn, also at Sumburgh Head on
October 10th. These spring and autumn movements may safely,
we think, be looked upon as local and not regular migrations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cypselid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Land Note.</i>&mdash;At Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire,
"Forth," first seen on May 9th after a wet day and cloudy;
quite numerous on 11th; a warm sunny day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturnin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;All records of Starlings&mdash;spring and autumn&mdash;are
light. Earliest in Spring, Feb. 15th, one at Sumburgh
Head and a flock at Isle of May. Latest, Dec. 26th
(autumn), a few at Isle of May. Most spring records in
March; five records at four stations (Sumburgh Head, Pentland
Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May); on 7th (Sumburgh
Head), 5th (Bell Rock), 2nd, large flock (Isle of May), and 17th
(Pentland Skerries). Prevailing wind S.E., and haze. In April
great numbers on 3rd (young birds) at Sumburgh Head, and
large numbers on 15th. At Inchkeith a pair built for the
first time for eight years, and reared young.</p>

<p>In autumn, large flocks every day, about beginning of August,
at Isle of May (earliest) up to September 19th, when all left,
mostly young. Up to date, wind easterly, changed on 20th
to W. An increase observed on October 25th at Isle of May
again. Intermittent and rare in November, all over, and on
18th a strong S.E. gale, apparently drove them all away. In
December a few seen on 12th and 26th, and a few on Jan. 12th,
1885.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larks.</span>&mdash;Spring, heavy migration, but confined in time.
Earliest February 5th, at Bell Rock, and a few on eight dates
at Bell Rock, prevailing E. and S.E.; on 5th, light W. on
14th, 15th, and 16th, varying from gale S.E. at 9 p.m., on
15th, to W. Latest, April 3rd, at Sumburgh Head, great
numbers (along with Thrushes). Greatest rush, March 6th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">- 30 -</span>
at Bell Rock. All left 7th and 8th, and were succeeded by a
"great flock" on 8th again (with Thrushes) striking and
rebounding into the sea.</p>

<p>In autumn, no records till September 9th, then one at Bell
Rock; two other records in September, one at N. Unst and
one at Pentland Skerries. On Dec. 14th a rush took place,
with S.W. gale and sleet. Between 12th and 16th Nov. a
great rush at Bell Rock and Isle of May; on change of wind
from light S. to W. at 10.30 all left on 12th, but were succeeded
by great rush on 15th. The greatest rush on 12th (see <a href="#Turdidae">Thrushes</a>).
Another rush appears to have taken place on January 28th
and 31st, and intermittent movements on 25th and a few
other dates; a number on the 20th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Yellow Buntings at Isle of May, February
15th, two all day; light S.E. showers (earliest records of any
Buntings). In March 5th, seven Buntings at Isle of May, fresh
N.W. clear; and on 31st two Corn Buntings at Isle of May,
fresh N.W. clear; and on 31st two Corn Buntings, fresh S. In
April two single records of "Buntings," 5th and 21st, light S.E.
with a movement of other species. In May, three records of
Corn Buntings, on 2nd, 12th, and 22nd, at Pentland Skerries,
W. and variable. In July a common (Corn) Bunting was
observed at Pentland Skerries, on 7th, moderate S.E., fog.</p>

<p>In autumn, returns light, as compared with most years.
Earliest Snow Bunting at Pentland Skerries on September 17th
("first seen"), one bird. In October, very few at Pentland
Skerries and Isle of May, but thousands&mdash;a rush of Snow
Buntings&mdash;at N. Ronaldshay on 12th and 25th October. Rush
November 12th to 15th (with other species). Snow Buntings
usually appear with gales and snow and sleet, but this year
have come in clear weather as a rule. Great numbers at
N. Ronaldshay on December 5th, and have been there since last
date. A few stray records of Yellow Buntings in December, and
in January, 1885, and one flock of Snow Buntings on Jan. 4th,
1885.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuculid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Only records are May 11th, one at Isle of May,
and at same station June 11th and 17th, light S.E. and clear,
both dates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strigid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;No records.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falconid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;As usual there are numbers of records of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">- 31 -</span>
Hawks, Falcons, &amp;c., at most of the island stations&mdash;so many
indeed that we consider it unnecessary to notice them in full, as
we have hitherto done, except where rarities occur or where
distinct migratory movements are clearly seen. Records of
Falconid&aelig; run all through the year in most seasons, and
generally apparent, mostly due to local flights, pursuing
waders or land birds. Thus in February, March, April,
and May; but apparently, in 1884, not observed in June
and July, re-appear in August, September, October and
November, but are not recorded in December this year.
Lightest returns in February, March, April and May in spring;
lightest in August, November and December in autumn.
Heaviest returns in September and October. They participate
<i>less</i> in spring migration, and search of food, as at that time
they have more local habits and are preparing their nesting-places,
but <i>more</i> in autumn, because the young are hatched off,
able to look after themselves, and working hard in the "struggle
for existence."</p>

<p>The species mentioned in spring are as follows:&mdash;Game
Hawk (Peregrine Falcon), Merlin, Eagles (seen several times at
Sumburgh Head in April, breeding near at hand), Sea Eagles,
Sparrowhawks. And in autumn, Game Hawk, Kestrel, "Yellow-spotted
Hawk", "Large Yellow-spotted Hawk," (Isle of May)
Merlin, Large Blue-backed, "with a white ring round front of
the neck, too small for a Goshawk."</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;We want badly to have specimens for identification
of different Hawks.</p>

<p>In September we have ten records of above species, at two
stations, and in October ten more also at the same stations,
<i>viz.</i>: Pentland Skerries and Isle of May; on eight dates in
September and eight dates in October.</p>

<p>We do not think more minute data will serve any useful
purpose, except where decided migrations of large numbers of
Hawks are observed, or distinctly foreign or new and unusual
species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelecanid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;We have records of Solan Geese in every
month in the year except January, November and December, but
on only one date in February, three in March, four in April; but
bulking heavier. Great numbers in May, continuing in June,
increasing in July, and continuously in flocks in September.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">- 32 -</span>
But in October only one record, and that on the 2nd. We
will yet have to see where all our Gannets congregate during
these three months; they are absent from our British coasts, or,
at least, at their scarcest.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> From the date of the first
(February) record the almost invariable direction of flight given
is "flying east," or easterly; but one record at Sumburgh Head
gives "a number flying N. on April 11th, light N. clear,"<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> on
to the date of September 17th. But on the 19th September an
unmistakable change takes place, and while we still find up to
October 2nd, Solans flying east, we also find that from Sept.
19th Solans were also flying west, past all the stations sending
returns, <i>viz.</i>, Pentland Skerries and Dunnet Head. I wish
more correspondents both on East Coast of Scotland, at say
Noss Head and Buchanness, and St. Abb's Head, and on the
West Coast at Barra Head, Stoir Head, and Rhinns of Islay,
would return daily records of the movements of Gannets,
specially noting the direction and flight of flocks.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> At Sumburgh Head the migration appears local, "passing N. or S.
during the herring fishery." In this connection see <a href="#General_Remarks2">General Remarks</a> regarding
Gulls, at the end of West Coast of Scotland, and the movements of sprats
(<i>Clupea</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>Solan Geese bulked largest in July, flying E., and the return
rush appears to have taken place two months after, in September.
On January 5th, 1885 there is one record of five
Solans flying E. Fresh W. cloudy at Pentland Skerries. We
would ask Mr. Gilmour, or the principal light-keeper at this
station, to carefully record any movements of Solans during
the winter months which come under his observations.</p>

<p>Since the above was written a late schedule from N. Ronaldshay
reports Solan Geese flying north every day between July
5th and about Sept. 1st in flocks all day of torn two or three
to twenty.</p>

<p>To 1885.&mdash;In February, 1885, seven Gannets flying W. on
12th, and three on 21st.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Herons are recorded from March to June
sparingly. None in July or August. Sparingly again in
September, none in October, and a few in November,&mdash;a very

<p><span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Thirteen Swans at N. Unst seen flying N.W. on
April 3rd, light airs, clear, and at same station three seen resting
on the loch on Oct. 30th, wind light S.W. and rain. Of geese
no spring records. In autumn, fifteen Wild Geese on Oct. 26th,
flying S.; strong W. gale on 25th, and N.W. on 26th. In
November, three grey geese seen flying west at Pentland Skerries;
wind fresh W.N.W. clear (marked "rare"). Of Eider Ducks,
earliest notice at Isle of May, a few small flocks on March 23rd,
W. to N.W.; a large flock ("very few hitherto") on April 19th,
and another (the same?) on May 11th. No more, except such as
breed there, at least no records till Sept. 24th; thirty-four
Eiders (three old males and one King Eider with them). This
flock had, however, been frequenting along shore for some days.
The King Eider was a splendid male, and was watched a whole
day at six or eight different vantage-points with a powerful
glass. Next day, while all the Eiders were still there, this bird
disappeared. During the three weeks I spent on Isle of May in
September and October, flocks of Eiders were never absent,
shifting their position according to the direction of the wind,
and diving, as is their habit, in the very midst of the angry
surf. The largest number counted in a flock was fifty (six
males) on Oct. 6th.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> I saw some thirty or forty dead Eider Ducks and Drakes at a birdstuffers
in Edinburgh in February, shot in Orkney by a Mr. Scott, of
Meadow Bank, Edinburgh; I should be glad if Mr. Scott would tell me if he
shot them for sport, or for what reason.</p>

<p>Teal, one record at Pentland Skerries on June 25th, light
N.W., resting on island; and one Wigeon at Isle of May on
June 11th; one Wild Duck, one Teal, Isle of May, Oct. 1st;
large numbers of Wigeons and Scaups in the Moray Firth by
Nov. 16th, and Barnicle Geese; one Teal and one R. B. Merganser,
shot at Isle of May (<i>in mus.</i> Isle of May) on 25th and
27th Nov. But at N. Ronaldshay Eiders began to arrive by
September 1st, and remain all winter in hundreds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columbid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Wood Pigeons: one at Isle of May on 6th
September, light W., clear; a large flock flying N.W., wind N.,
light, clear, on 14th November; about one hundred on 26th,
flying N., wind light W.N.W. No other records from any other

<p><i>Land Note.</i>&mdash;In January, at Glenboerie, Stirlingshire, Stock
Doves appeared, and my keeper sent in two along with two Wood
Pigeons. This species is rapidly spreading and increasing in
Scotland. (See last Report, p. 25.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>) This is the first record in

<p><span class="smcap">Rallid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Corn Crake arrived at Pentland Skerries, 17th
May; heard first time at Cromarty on 14th May; and one
recorded at Isle of May, with rush of other migrants, on
the 11th.</p>

<p>In autumn, the last old Corn Crakes were seen at Pentland
Skerries, but young are still on island on 12th September; but
on 7th November, at same station, one young bird was still frequenting
the island; and on 8th January is again recorded, with
the remark, "This bird seems to have been here all the season;"
and therefore the records above, from 12th September to 8th
January, 1885, probably all refer to the same solitary young
bird, which, perhaps unable to leave at the time, yet has been
able to survive the winter. We would like to hear more of this
bird's behaviour, if Mr. J. Gilmour can give us further notes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charadriad&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Lapwing or Peewit, a light movement only
in spring, and scarcely any records at all in autumn. A few at
Sumburgh Head on 14th and 22nd; light S.S.E.; and on 25th,
fresh N., a few all day on island; a few single or light entries
in March at Isle of May; most (seven) on 17th; and in June, two
on 9th, at Sumburgh Head; lighter returns than in 1883, even;
one at Pentland Skerries, 1st December. Scarcely any movements
of Golden Plover recorded, and only at Pentland Skerries,
4th July, a flock; several one day in August, fresh S.E., fog;
and at Sumburgh Head large flocks on 26th and 28th September.
At N. Ronaldshay flocks of Golden Plover visit the island, about
the 25th August, and many remain all winter. Oystercatchers,
few records are given; two at Pentland Skerries on 16th March,
and very large numbers at Sumburgh Head on 29th August.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scolopacid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Scarcer in spring than in 1883, and no rush
appreciable; no records in April, and only stray entries on 16th,
25th, and 30th May. In July various slight records; all local
migrations for food, no doubt, even when flocking together; or it
may be, beginning to migrate, when in flocks, on 22nd and 24th
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">- 35 -</span>
July; and from that, on to 21st October, flocks on many dates;
wind S.E. in September at N. stations up to 20th, or thereby;
but in October northerly and westerly, or N.E. gales. When
direction of flight is given it is usually East in autumn, distinguishing,
of course, between real migrants and only local
movements. Fifty Curlews at N. Ronaldshay on 22nd August;
remain all winter; and a few shot usually by Mr. J. Tulloch.</p>

<p>In autumn, a considerable migration; a good Woodcock
year. Earliest migrants recorded: one at Pentland Skerries,
14th October, moderate E., after a N.N.E. gale; with Snipe, and
rush of other species. Latest, about 17th November, at Isle of
May; five shot. Rush of Woodcocks between 12th and 17th, at
Pentland Skerries; but especially at Isle of May, on 4th (six
shot), 11th (four shot), 12th (ten shot). Few records in October,
and this migration was delayed by adverse winds during that
month.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> A number are scheduled from N. Ronaldshay, on the
island, all day; on 8th November light S.W. and rain, and the
remark, "I never saw so many Woodcocks on the island since I
came here." All left in a few days. One on 2nd December, at
Isle of May; and on 12th and 20th January, 1855. Of Snipe,
not many records. Earliest, one at Isle of May, 23rd April; and
on 1st May at Pentland Skerries. Three Jack Snipe at same
place, 4th July (an unusually early arrival, J. A. H. B.), moderate
E., fog. Latest, four at Isle of May, 28th November; and Jack
Snipe, one at Isle of May on 25th; few records in October; but
indication of a rush in November, with other species, between
16th and 20th. At North Ronaldshay numbers of Snipe seen
rising out of all marshy places on 17th November. One Jack
Snipe torn open in striking.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> At Torwood, near this, I saw
nineteen Woodcocks shot on 13th December (J. A. H. B.), and
many other good bags of Woodcock are on record this autumn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">- 36 -</span>
and winter. They were, however, unusually scarce in the
shooting season. Of Waders, generally, there are many entries,
including Redshanks, "Sandpipers," Purple Sandpipers (Isle of
May and Pentland Skerries), Turnstones, Ringed Plover and
Dunlin (Isle of May), which we do not consider it necessary to
detail. The rushes of other species indicate also the details of
the above.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> One Woodcock struck hard on the west side of the dome at Isle of
May, flying dead against light east wind, and was found next morning 100
yards to the N.E., and shot by a friend. Its breast was torn open, and much
lacerated. It may have struck the side of the dome, and glanced off; but
we were in the lantern-room at the time, and it sounded on the W. side. It
had evidently dropped after striking outside the balcony, and then, recovering,
flew straight for the Pilot House, the white-washed walls of which were
reflecting the lantern-light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sternin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Few records. Terns arrived at Pentland Skerries
on 11th May; and at Cromarty the Lesser Tern arrived on 4th
May. The Terns left about the 20th August, and the Lesser
Terns on the 15th, with light S.W. wind. In September a flock
of Terns passed Bell Rock on the 15th, and on the 17th a flock
kept round the lantern all night, strong N.W., and disappeared
with daylight.</p>

December 12th and 13th, large numbers; and
again on 29th, at Isle of May. Unusually abundant in Firth of
Forth, with Little Auks and Puffins, in January, 1885.</p>

<p>Our report on the E. coast of Scotland includes all schedules
between February 1st, 1884, and January 31st, 1885, which have
come to hand in time.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> It is important for me to have all schedules dating as near as possible
to January 31st in each year returned as filled up to date, as the work of
arranging the large amount of material is much simplified if <i>all</i> schedules
are to hand as soon after the last entry as possible.</p>

<p>Schedules were sent to thirty-eight stations, lighthouses
and light-vessels, on the East Coast of England, and returns
have been received from twenty-six.</p>

<p>Independent reports have been received from Malmo,
Sweden; Stevns Fyr (lighthouse of Stevns), Zealand; and from
Heligoland. Also from several land stations on the East Coast,
namely Northumberland coast, Seaton-Carew, Redcar, Flamborough,
Spurn, Great Cotes (Lincolnshire), Blakeney and Cley,
Wells and Cromer (Norfolk), Yarmouth and the Isle of Thanet;
altogether thirty-seven reporting stations against thirty-five in
1883. The total number of schedules sent in is seventy, a
considerable increase on previous years, and the labour of
arranging, tabulating and reporting thereon has been considerably
increased.</p>

<p>The schedules received from the light-keepers are very
satisfactory; they register an immense amount of special
information relating to the passage of migrants in the spring
and autumn of 1884; the entries are so numerous, and the mass
of materials so large, that it is impossible to give more than the
general results of the collected observations.</p>

<p>The notes from land stations, courteously placed at our
disposal by independent observers, many of whom are practical
ornithologists of long standing and repute, add greatly to the
value of the report, and go far to establish the approximate
correctness of the details as given in the separate remarks on
each species.</p>

<p>Our thanks are due to Frank K. Newton, Professor H.
L&uuml;tken, H. G&auml;tke, T. H. Nelson, C. Donald Thompson, Matthew
Bailey, W. Eagle Clarke, the Rev. H. H. Slater, Philip Lawton,
J. H. Gurney, J. F. D. Power, M. Vaughan, and Lord Clifton, for
kind co-operation and assistance, either in direct communication
or by access to their unpublished field notes, some of which will
probably subsequently appear in the Journals and Proceedings of
various Natural History Societies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">- 40 -</span></p>

<p>The greatest number of schedules received from any one
station are nine from Mr. Thomas H. Cutting of the Inner
Farn Lighthouse, and four from Mr. Owen Boyle of the Languard
Lighthouse.</p>

covering the whole east coast. In fact, since the middle of
October to the second week in the new year, Fieldfares, Red-wings,
Thrushes and Blackbirds, have been coming in at
intervals, young birds first, and the old later in the year.
Unusually large flights of Fieldfares are recorded at inland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">- 42 -</span>
stations in December and January. Heligoland, Oct. 14th, first;
19th, early, flights of hundreds; 29th, great many, also caught

numerous stations between the Farn Islands and Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Guernsey, in October, and marvellous numbers in November
with the like lateral range; Nov. 11th, 12th, and 13th, an
almost continuous rush night and day, with S.E. winds and a
low pressure area in Western Europe.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Great Cotes, Nov. 26th,
first old cocks with yellow bills. Hasborough <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Jan. 19th

reports. Heligoland, first, Oct. 11th, and at intervals to Nov.
5th, up to which date no old cock had been seen; last on
Nov. 10th and 12th. The migration of this species at Heligoland
is very light compared with the English coast.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> This rush appears to have, in a greater or less degree, covered the
whole of the east coast. At the Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Farn Islands, it is
recorded by our observer, Mr. T. 0. Hall, as follows:&mdash;"Nov. 10th, all
kinds of small birds coming all day, one Snipe seen, wind southerly, hazy
weather; at 8 a.m., three grey crows to E. 11th, birds still coming, all
kinds, or rather the small kind, two Snipe, and one Woodcock. 12th, great
rush of Blackbirds, Ouzel, a few Mistletoe Thrushes., Redwings, Lapwings,
Grey and Golden Plover, as well as Woodcock and Snipe. This is the
greatest rush of the season, and lasted all day up to 10 p.m.; complete
absence of Starlings; wind all day from S. to S. by W., after midnight
changing to N.W." There was no corresponding rush across Heligoland
during the same period.</p>

</div>

<p><i>T. torquatus</i>, Ring Ouzel.&mdash;Spring, 1884: Farn Islands,
March 23rd to 29th, a few. Autumn: first seen, Sept. 9th,

north to south, both of home birds and others which had crossed
the North Sea. Spurn, Sept. 13th, "rush," many all day; last
Wheatear seen in Great Cotes marshes, near the Humber, on
November 7th. Heligoland, August 1st and 3rd, a few; 5th,
twenty or so, and then a considerable migration to the 22nd,
when the movement for the time ceased, commencing again on
the 27th, and was continued through September to the 19th;
the first old birds on October 3rd, and again some young on the
12th, when the passage appears to have ceased. Immense
numbers covered the island on the 12th of Sept. and three
following days, wind E.S.E., clear and fine.</p>

<p><i>S. stapazina</i>, Black-throated Wheatear.&mdash;Heligoland, Oct.
2nd, one, probable, not obtained.</p>

<p><i>Pratincola rubetra</i>, Whinchat.&mdash;No English notes. Heligoland,
August 15th, some on cliff; 17th, great numbers; 18th
and 19th, the same, and on to the end of the month, through

numbers with others on the 14th and 15th Sept.</p>

<p><i>P. rubicola</i>, Stonechat.&mdash;Spurn, August 29th, considerable
immigration of young birds; Sept. 26th, many old. In
North-east Lincolnshire we have had a sprinkling of old
birds about the sheep-folds in turnip fields all through the
winter.</p>

<p><i>Ruticilla ph&#339;nicurus</i>, Redstart.&mdash;Spring: Farn Islands,
April 7th, one; 29th, S.E., many. Malmo, Sweden, May 5th,
two or three in garden. Autumn: Spurn, Aug. 25th, first, to
Thanet, Oct. 5th, last on passage up coast; rushes on Sept. 4th,
11th, 12th, and 17th. Heligoland, August 11th, first, young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">- 44 -</span>
birds; enormous passage on 20th and 21st, easterly, hot and
fine; through September, and an astounding rush from the
12th to the 15th; last, Oct. 1st and 2nd.</p>

<p><i>R. titys</i>, Black Redstart.&mdash;One, as reported by Mr. Gurney,
shot at Blakeney, about the middle of October, by Mr. Seebohm.
Heligoland, Oct. 23rd, some; 25th, less. Three to four weeks
later in migration than Common Redstart.</p>

<p><i>Cyanecula suecica</i>, Arctic Bluethroat.&mdash;Cley and Blakeney (as
observed by Mr. F. D. Power), September 8th, W.N.W., one;
11th, E. to N.N.E., one shot showing red spot fairly well; 12th,
E. to N., eighty to one hundred, also many Redstarts,&mdash;examples
obtained were immature, and in the proportion of six males to
one female; 13th, E.N.E., about four dozen left on banks; 15th,
E., eight or ten; 16th, S.E., and later N.E., four or five. Spurn,
Sept. 15th, two seen, one shot; 18th, three shot and others seen.
Isle of Thanet, Sept. 15th, two seen on some arable land by
Lord Clifton. Heligoland, Aug. 31st, some young; Sept. 1st
and 3rd, pretty numerous; 9th and 10th, very many; 11th and
12th, very great numbers, and less to 18th; 19th and 20th,
many. It is interesting to compare these dates with the arrival
on the English coast.</p>

<p><i>Erithacus rubecula</i>, Redbreast.&mdash;Spring: Farn Islands,

night on deck. Heligoland, Sept. 19th, a few; 21st, great
many, and on to the end of month, and at intervals through
October to November 12th, rush, if any, Oct. 12th. Migration
appears to have ceased at the same date both on English coast
and at Heligoland.</p>

<p><i>Sylvia cinerea</i>, Whitethroat.&mdash;Heligoland, Aug. 19th, young,
the first, very red; 21st and 23rd, a few; Sept. 11th, some.</p>

17th, S.E., one struck and killed, several seen on following
day; many Redstarts, Pied Flycatchers, and Bluethroats, also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">- 45 -</span>
arriving on night of 17th. Heligoland, Aug. 27th, a few
(no <i>curruca</i>); Sept. 1st and 9th.</p>

<p><i>S. nisoria</i>, Barred Warbler.&mdash;Spurn, Aug. 28th, one, a
female of the year, obtained by Mr. Slater (See 'Zoologist,
1884, p. 489). Cley, Norfolk, Sept. 4th, N.E., one, which was
also an immature female, shot by Mr. F. D. Power.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> This makes the third occurrence of the Barred Warbler in the British
Isles. The first is recorded near Cambridge by Professor Newton, Proc.
Zool. Soc, 1879, p. 219.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Regulus cristatus</i>, Goldcrest.&mdash;Spring: One recorded from
Spurn, Coquet, and Farn Islands, last fortnight in March, and
at the Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, one on April 28th. Autumn: First at
Redcar, August 28th, and last at Great Cotes, early morning of
Nov. 22nd, N.E., blowing strong on previous night; the migration
covering eighty-seven days, and extending over the whole
coast between the Farn Islands and Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Guernsey.
Bushes took place on August 14th, Sept. 27th to 30th, Oct. 21st
to 22nd, and Nov. 16th. At Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 30th, from 2 a.m.,
the windows of the lantern were crowded with Goldcrests. On
Oct. 21st and 22nd, great numbers each night round the lanterns
of Dudgeon and Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>'s, wind S.S.E., and on
Nov. 16th many during night round the lantern of Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>
Malmo, Sweden, Sept. 22nd, in flocks, but only remained one
day. Heligoland, Oct. 3rd, great many; 8th, many during
afternoon, and at intervals to 25th; greatest number on 12th

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> Bean-fields near the coast are always a very favourite haunt in the
early autumn of the soft-billed insect-feeders. I have frequently at this
season found such places swarming with various Warblers, Wagtails, and
Pipits, the situation affording the very best cover as well as an abundance
of food in the numerous insects and their larv&aelig; which infest the bean plant
in its latter growth.</p>

</div>

<p><i>M. flava</i>, Blue-headed Yellow Wagtail.&mdash;Thanet, Aug. 16th,

Aug. 19th.</p>

<p><i>Muscicapa grisola</i>, Spotted Flycatcher.&mdash;Numerous entries in
the schedules of "Flycatchers," a general name for all the small
insect-feeders; it is impossible to pick out those which refer to
this species exclusively. Heligoland, Aug. 21st, some, the first,
and sparingly in September to the 17th.</p>

<p><i>M. atricapilla</i>, Pied Flycatcher.&mdash;Spring: Malmo, Sweden,

<p><i>Hirundo rustica</i>, Swallow.&mdash;Spring: Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, April 7th,
two, Flamborough and Whitby on the 8th, and Farn Islands on
the 9th, a gradual movement north, at the rate of 150 English
miles a day. Malmo, Sweden, first, on April 21st. Great
numbers were observed at Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, passing north up to
May 11th; and at the Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on the 8th, 9th, 11th, and
17th of May, large numbers all day from S.E. to N.W.
Languard <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, June 21st, a flock too numerous to count.
Autumn: Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, July 1st, six, at 9.30 p.m., came on board
and remained all night. From the middle of August and
throughout September Swallows were passing south up the coast
in parties of five to fifteen, and at Spurn, on Sept. 26th, 27th,
28th, continuous each day by two's and three's. In North-east
Lincolnshire, some on Nov. 3rd. The last reported is from the

many in flocks. Immense numbers crossed Heligoland between
the 28th of November and 26th of December: "Enormous
numbers all the month, more than ever seen before." The
greatest flights, Nov. 28th to 30th and Dec. 20th to 26th.
Unusually large numbers are recorded by Mr. J. H. Gurney
['Zoologist,' 1885, p. 150], about Norwich and also about
Brighton in the winter of 1884-5.</p>

<p><i>Coccothraustes vulgaris</i>, Hawfinch.&mdash;Inner Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct.
22nd, 4 p.m., "one on board, and then to W." This is the third
year in succession that this species has occurred at this station.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">- 50 -</span>
In 1882, on Oct. 20th, two on board all night; and in 1883, on
Nov. 2nd, one struck the lantern.</p>

<p><i>Passer domesticus</i>, House Sparrow.&mdash;Spring: Outer Dowsing
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, April 9th, six on board. In the autumn great numbers are
recorded at stations between the Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> and Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Guernsey, between Sept. 9th and Nov. 25th, the bulk crossing
south of the Humber; rush, Oct. 14th and 15th, and on to the
19th. Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 14th, large numbers to W.N.W.

dropping into the sea." Goodwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 15th, 21st, and 25th,
shoals. Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 18th, 9 to 12 a.m., flocks, thirty to forty,
to south; and many other notices too numerous to mention.
Heligoland, Aug. 21st, a flight, the first; 22nd, the same; Sept.
30th, several great flights.</p>

<p><i>P. montanus</i>, Tree Sparrow.&mdash;The migration covered the
whole of the East coast, the bulk crossing south of the Humber.
First recorded at Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept. 9th, immense flocks of both
the Tree and Common Sparrow, and from this date up to Nov.
25th at the majority of the East coast stations, ten of them
light-vessels. Rushes, Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 15th, continuous all

smart migration.</p>

<p><i>Fringilla c&#339;lebs</i>, Chaffinch.&mdash;The migration is very extensive,
and covers the whole of the East coast, the bulk, as in the two
preceding cases, crossing south of the Humber. Through
September and October immense numbers are recorded as
crossing, the first flocks young of both sexes and old females;
old cocks later. Rushes, Farn Islands, Oct. 16th. Orfordness
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, 15th and 18th. Hasbro' <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 21st, all night. Farns and
Hasbro' <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Nov. 2nd; also at Redcar, Nov. 20th, N.E., very
stormy. Direction of flight W. to W.S.W. Heligoland, an
immense migration at intervals, between Sept. 19th and Nov. 1st;
great rushes, Sept. 29th, and Oct. 1st, 23rd, and 24th. On Feb.
22nd, 1885, very large flights in Great Cotes, marshes apparently
composed entirely of the young of the previous year, the young
cocks being in every stage of development to the mature summer
plumage.</p>

<p><i>Fringilla montifringilla</i>, Brambling.&mdash;Coast of Northumberland,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">- 51 -</span>
Oct. 5th, first. Thanet, 20th, two; Nov. 11th, common;
Dec. 3rd, first, in small flocks. Heligoland, Sept. 19th, a few,
and at intervals to Nov. 30th; rushes on 23rd and 24th of Oct.,
S.E., clear; and Nov. 30th, southerly, with snow.</p>

<p><i>Linota cannabina</i>, Linnet.&mdash;From Sept. 9th to the end of
October in great numbers, far too numerous to separately record.
The immense arrivals in the autumn appear to move gradually
south up the coast, comparatively few lingering in North-east
Lincolnshire after the completion of the stubble ploughing.
Heligoland, Oct. 1st, some, and to Dec. 1st; rushes on Oct. 2nd,
astounding numbers; 24th, very great many; and the three last
days in November and first of December.</p>

<p><i>L. rufescens</i>, Lesser Redpoll.&mdash;Heligoland, Nov. 22nd, one.</p>

<p><i>L. flavirostris</i>, Twite.&mdash;Heligoland, Oct. 21st, flight, fifty to

station, Oct. 8th, two; Nov. 25th, one.</p>

<p><i>Loxia curvirostra</i>, Crossbill.&mdash;Heligoland, Aug. 16th, N.,
eleven.</p>

<p><i>Emberiza miliaria</i>, Corn Bunting.&mdash;Heligoland, Oct. 25th, ten
to twenty, "great many for this place;" Nov. 3rd, ten to fifteen.
The Corn Bunting is always a very scarce migrant across
Heligoland.</p>

<p><i>E. citrinella</i>, Yellowhammer.&mdash;Heligoland, Oct. 12th, some;
and a few at intervals to the 25th.</p>

<p><i>E. hortulana</i>, Ortolan Bunting.&mdash;Cley, Norfolk, Sept. 12th,
E. to N., one, an immature female, shot by Mr. F. D. Power.
Heligoland, a very large migration, commencing August 16th,
and continued to Sept. 19th; rushes on August 18th to 23rd
and the 31st; Sept. 3rd, "a few fine old males"; 4th, great
many, all in great haste, and on the 5th again old birds; Sept.
10th to 15th, enormous numbers, and then less to the 19th.</p>

<p><i>E. pusilla</i>, Little Bunting.&mdash;Heligoland, Oct. 5th, N.E.,
fresh, two.</p>

<p><i>E. sch&#339;niclus</i>, Reed Bunting.&mdash;On the Holderness, Lincolnshire
and Norfolk coasts the arrival was very large in September
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">- 52 -</span>
and October; the migration commencing the first week in
September. At Great Cotes, October 30th, still very numerous.
Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 15th, "three came on board, one remaining a
week." Heligoland, Sept. 26th, "a few during last days;"
Oct. 6th, some; 7th, many; 11th, very great many; 12th,
astounding numbers; 14th, many; 15th, same; 21st to 25th,
less; 30th, some. This very well represents the general
order of migration at the island; first a few, then a rush for
some days culminating in astounding numbers, after which
there is a gradual falling away till the migration of that special
species ceases altogether.</p>

<p><i>Calcarius lapponicus</i>, Lapland Bunting.&mdash;Cley, Norfolk, Sept.
17th, N.E., one, a young male, obtained by Mr. F. D. Power.
Great Cotes, Nov. 27th, one, a mature male ('Zoologist,' 1884,
p. 484); Nov. 11th, one near Brighton, shown in the flesh to
Mr. Gurney. Heligoland, Sept. 19th, a few; Oct. 3rd, a few;
7th, many; 12th and 16th, some.</p>

<p><i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>, Snow Bunting.&mdash;Spring: Farn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
March 11th, two on island; Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, June 7th, one on
rock. Autumn: Northumberland Coast, Sept. 15th, one shot;
sparingly in October, at the more northern stations, and
tolerably plentiful from Spurn to Yarmouth, in the latter half of
November; rushes, Nov. 24th, 25th and 26th, into Humber
district. Great Cotes, marshes, also at this date, Nov. 25th,
sharp frost, Pink-footed Goose; great flights of Golden Plover,
Snipe large numbers; immense flocks of Linnets, Greenfinches,
Larks, Chaffinches and Tree Sparrows, fields covered; Nov. 26th,
still sharp frost, scores of old male Blackbirds, fields swarming
with small birds as before, with the addition of flights of newly-arrived
Wood Pigeons, which appear a smaller race than our
home-bred birds. All this time Snow Buntings, chiefly old
birds. Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Dec. 7th, 16th and 17th, large flocks to S.W.
and N.W. Heligoland, Oct. 16th first; 29th, many; Nov. 5th,
large flights; 29th, great many.</p>

<p><i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>, Starling.&mdash;Spring: Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, March 3rd,
3 a.m. to daybreak, misty, S.S.E., numbers round lantern.
Outer Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 16th, a flight; 17th, continuous noon to
5 p.m., going W.N.W. to E.S.E. Autumn: First at Whitby
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> Sept. 2nd, great many for several days. Spurn, 20th, all
day to S. Immense rushes in October more or less over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">- 53 -</span>
whole coast line, and during the latter half of the month almost
continuous night and day. At Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 24th,
5 p.m., 5000, S.E. to N.W., fifty killed. Coquet Island <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
many round lantern all through November. Heligoland, in
duration and number the migration probably exceeds that of any
other species, commencing with young birds on June 28th,
and continued at intervals to the end of the year; enormous
numbers crossed between the 14th and 25th of October,
especially on the 19th, "immense numbers;" 20th, "clouds of
enormous numbers;" 21st, "astounding;" 22nd, "astounding
flights like clouds passing on," and so on in less numbers to the
end of the year.</p>

<p><i>Pastor roseus</i>, Rose-coloured Pastor.&mdash;Aug. 30th, one shot
near Spurn, and another reputed to have been seen. Mr.
Slater, who saw this bird, says it was in very dusky plumage,
and its colouring very much that of an old Hooded Crow, but
it was an adult female, and dissection showed that it had
bred this season.</p>

<p><i>Corvus monedula</i>, Daw.&mdash;In large flocks at several stations in
October and November, frequently mixed with Rooks. Heligoland,
first on October 6th; 12th, many; 15th, several flights;
24th and 25th, astounding numbers.</p>

<p><i>C. corone</i>, Carrion Crow.&mdash;Large numbers appear to have
come over in October. There are innumerable entries in the
schedules of "black crows" and "grey crows," and of course it
is quite impossible to say in each case whether Carrion Crows or
Rooks are intended. In those instances where the flocks are
mixed, grey and black Crows together, the latter are probably
<i>C. corone</i>. Rooks, as a rule, keep to themselves when migrating,
or mixed with Jackdaws.</p>

Dec. 23rd, a few about lantern all night; the migration covering
109 days, and including twenty-four stations between the
Farn Islands and Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, fourteen of which are light vessels.
From Sept. 30th to the middle of Nov. enormous numbers crossed
the North Sea either directly from E. to W., a point S. of E. to
other N. of W., and from the 15th of Oct. to the end of the
month the rush appears to have been nearly continuous night
and day; the great rush from the 20th to the 23rd. At Heligoland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">- 55 -</span>
the migration commenced on the 22nd of Sept. with pretty
large flights, and continued at intervals to the end of the year;
on the 21st October an enormous migration over the sea on
each side of the island; night of 24th to 25th, great rush, 500
caught at lighthouse.</p>

less; Nov. 2nd and 3rd, many; 10th and 11th, hundreds constantly,
and at intervals to Dec. 1st in large numbers. When
we consider the very few which appear on this side of the North
Sea compared with the vast numbers passing Heligoland in the
autumn, it becomes a matter of surprise where they all go, and
in what lands they find winter-quarters.</p>

at sea, mainly young.</p>

<p><i>Ardea cinerea</i>, Heron.&mdash;At many stations in the autumn, but
it is impossible to say whether immigrants or not. Herons have
been very common in the autumn and winter in all the low-lying
districts in North-east Lincolnshire. On the evening of February
3rd, 1885, fourteen, flying close together, passed over me within
half-gunshot, steering their course in the direction of the nearest
"beck."</p>

<p><i>Botaurus stellaris</i>, Bittern.&mdash;One shot in Gedney Marsh on

Norfolk, and one in Suffolk, during the first week in December,
and one near Brigg, Lincolnshire, in January, 1885. Snow and
severe frosts on Continent from Nov. 28th to Dec. 2nd. It is
probable that the bulk of these visitors were shot within a week
of their arrival on our shores.</p>

April 28th, twenty, of which four were males off island. May
8th, many Ducks and Drakes, and at the same station in
December many off island. Farn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Jan. 11th and 12th,
1885, hundreds swimming in lee of island. The first young
were seen on June 13th. The King Eider, <i>Somateria spectabilis</i>,
was seen at the Farn Islands on April 9th, and at the Longstone
on May 4th. This bird, which has now regularly appeared
in the locality for several years, was unfortunately shot at on
June 12th, and was not seen afterwards.</p>

<p><i>&#338;demia nigra</i>, Common Scoter.&mdash;Gull <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, April 27th, 8 a.m.

<p><i>Columba palumbus</i>, Ring Dove.&mdash;Orfordness, Sept. 27th,
9 p.m., one struck, killed. Languard, 29th, 8 a.m., eight flying
very quick W. to N.E. Between 21st of October and the end of
November there was an immense immigration covering the East
Coast between Berwick and Yarmouth; rushes Oct. 21st to 25th,
Nov. 2nd and 20th to 28th, continuous for nine days. Mr. T. H.
Nelson says "there was an enormous arrival of these birds in
the Redcar neighbourhood about the middle of November. I
have not noted all down in the schedule, as I did not see them
all myself, but am told that from the 20th to end of month there
was a continuous migration; a friend shot about fifty in three
days between Redcar and Marske; there was also a considerable
influx into the Bishop Auckland district about the
same time." In Northumberland the numbers were so large as
to attract general attention. In Lincolnshire the arrival was
immense, also on the Norfolk coast. Hundreds were shot on
their first arrival, their crops and stomachs containing no food,
invariably the case with all newly arrived migrants. Heligoland,
Oct. 3rd, flight of sixty; 12th, some; 25th, great many,
twenty to thirty in a flight.</p>

<p><i>C. &aelig;nas</i>, Stockdove.&mdash;Great numbers crossed in the autumn
with the ring doves, mixed or in separate flocks. In November I
saw one flock of four or five hundred in the Great Cotes marshes,
an enormous flight considering the limited number bred in
the district. From the beginning of December to the end of
February large flights have daily resorted to fields of young
clover, or those recently laid down with permanent grasses.</p>

<p><i>Turtur communis</i>, Turtle Dove.&mdash;Thanet, Oct. 4th, last seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rallid&aelig;</span>, <i>Rallus aquaticus</i>, Water Rail.&mdash;There appears to
have been a very considerable immigration between the third
week in September and at intervals to the end of November, and
through the autumn they were exceedingly plentiful in all
likely localities on the East Coast. Heligoland, Oct. 25th, some;
30th, two or three. <i>Porzana maruetta</i>, Spotted Crake. Redcar,

Great Cotes, the great flight of old birds on 25th and 26th Nov.
Heligoland, Aug. 1st to 3rd, N.N.W., numerous; 5th to 25th,

a thousand collected every night (H. H. S.). Heligoland, June
28th, several hundreds young. <i>&AElig;gialitis cantiana</i>, Kentish
Plover. Languard <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Aug. 12th, one.</p>

Twigmoor, Lincolnshire, young Woodcocks were hatched early
in May.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Autumn: The first is recorded at Coquet <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> on
Sept. 1st; the last at Hasboro' <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Jan. 20th, 1885, one
caught at night. The migration covered 142 days, the bulk
arriving between Oct. the 5th and Nov. 22nd. What is
usually termed by sportsmen the 'first flight' came in on the
nights of the 5th and 6th of October, wind easterly; another
flight between the 10th and 16th; the 'great flight' on the
night of the 28th, N.W. strong, with rain and colder weather;
on the 29th, forty were shot in one locality on the Lincolnshire
coast; there was again a second "great flight" from the 11th
to 13th of November. Independent of these rushes, Woodcocks
have been dropping in either singly or by two's and three's
throughout the last three months in the year, and more or
less over the whole coast line. Altogether the migration has
been much more desultory and prolonged than any previously
recorded by us. Heligoland, Oct. 6th, some; 12th, some; 14th,
twenty shot; 15th, about thirty shot; 19th, less; 23rd, some;

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">[32]</a> Woodcocks bred in Great Britain invariably leave in the autumn in
August and September, and their place is taken some weeks later by others
coming from the north. Woodcocks found on the East Coast in March are
either such as have wintered in these islands and are now on their return
journey, or in some cases our English birds returning to their nesting
haunts.</p>

Sept. 9th, several about, one caught, were passing W. Cley and
Blakeney, Sept. 16th, a considerable arrival. There was a very
considerable rush on to the East Coast in the last fortnight in
October, and again in November, from the Farn Islands to Yarmouth;
three distinct rushes at the dates Nov. 4th to 5th, S.W.,

<p>Professor Chr. Fr. L&uuml;tken, of the Universitetets Zoologiske
Museum, Copenhagen, again forwards a list of birds killed
against the lighthouse of Stevns, on the projecting part of
Zealand, marking the limit between the Baltic and Oresund.
The list has been drawn up by Mr. Autander, a physician living
in the neighbourhood of the lighthouse. In forwarding the list,
Mr. Autander observes that he has every reason to think it very
incomplete, as the interest bestowed upon it by the officers of
the lighthouse is rather indifferent; all birds fit to be eaten are
probably disposed of in this way, and do not always come under
his observation.</p>

<p>Under date of June 30th, Mr. Owen Boyle, of the Languard
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, reports, "a Sky Lark followed by a string of Bees. The
plaintive cries of this poor bird first attracted my attention, it
flew so close that I almost caught it; it was closely pursued by
a large number of Bees, and in its fright took to the
water followed by its pursuers. When last seen it was
making for the Essex coast." July 31st, at 10.14 a.m., "a
cloud of mosquitoes pitched in this neighbourhood, similar to
those seen in India; most of them were carried off at noon
by a light breeze."</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Williams, of the Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Guernsey, says,
under date of July 10th, "A great quantity of large ants with
wings passing. A great many settled on the rocks and about
the lighthouse. I have only once seen them before like this,
when I was stationed at the South Bishop Rock off the coast of
Wales."</p>

<p>The report for the East Coast of England shows that a great
migration was carried on for six months in the autumn and
winter of 1884-5. The schedules returned indicate that no one
place had special preference, and that the inflow of migrants
was equally distributed over the entire coast line.</p>

<p>The southerly movement of migrants was well established
in July, and from this time to the end of the third week
in January, 1885, there has been a steady flow, with slight
intermissions, of birds either passing up the coast to the
south or moving directly inland, the vast majority coming
from the east across the North Sea, and moving westward
or in westerly directions. Occasionally there have been heavy
rushes or persistent bird waves continuous for days, and even
weeks.</p>

<p>The periods of migration occupied by different species vary
greatly, from four weeks to as many months; no general rule
can be laid down in this respect.</p>

<p>As a rule, the young birds of the year migrate independently
of the old, and some weeks in advance; there are,
however, frequent exceptions to this, more especially late in the
season, when the flocks are sometimes composed of old and
young. With some of our shore birds, as Grey Plover, Knot,
Sanderling, a few old birds, still in summer plumage, arrive
very early in the season, some weeks later the main body of
the young, and lastly the bulk of the adults, the latter having
then assumed the ordinary winter dress.</p>

<p>The lines of migration have been those followed in previous
years, the vast majority of immigrants coming either directly
from east to west or from points south of east to others north
of west. The records of birds travelling from points north of
east are comparatively exceptional.</p>

<p>There was an immense and continuous rush, a gigantic
feathery tide, on to the coast from the middle of October (15th)
to the end of the month, migrants arriving continuously night
and day. This rush was continued at some of the stations
with but slight intermissions to the middle of November.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">- 69 -</span>
The last fortnight in October is the average annual period of
what may be called the "great rush" of immigrants on to
the East Coast of England.</p>

<p>In previous reports we have drawn attention to the fact of
a migration in opposite directions going on at the same time
over the North Sea. This is observed more particularly at southeastern
stations, on light vessels moored at many miles distance
from the nearest land, where, during the spring and autumn,
the same species of birds, as Crows, Rooks, Jackdaws, Starlings,
Larks, Sparrows, Buntings and Finches, are recorded crossing
the North Sea moving from opposite quarters and passing
both towards the British coast and towards the Continent.
This apparently abnormal movement in opposite directions is
again indicated in the autumn and spring of 1884-5.</p>

<p>In a recent article in the 'Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,' Professor
Newton tells us that "there is scarcely a bird of either
the Pal&aelig;arctic or Nearctic regions, whose habits are at all well
known, of which much the same may not be said; and hence
we are led to the conclusion that every bird of the Northern
Hemisphere is, to a greater or less degree, migratory in some
part or other of its range." There can be no doubt that in this
passage Professor Newton indicates the probable explanation of
the special phenomena attending a double migration as recorded
from time to time in our reports.</p>

<p>With very few exceptions, the vast majority of our British
birds, such as are generally considered habitual residents, the
young invariably, the old intermittingly, leave these islands in
the autumn, their place being taken by others, not always
necessarily of the same species, coming from more northern
latitudes, or from districts of Eastern Europe, where, on the
approach of winter, the conditions of locality and food-supply
are found less favourable to existence. These immigrants on
the approach of spring leave, moving back to the Continent on
the same lines, but in the reverse direction to those traversed in
the autumn; at the same time, also, our own birds return from
the Continent to their nesting-quarters in these islands. To give
one instance, out of many which might be cited, that of the
Blackbird:&mdash;In the autumn, during September, the young of
the year leave their summer-quarters, and their place is shortly
taken by others, likewise young birds, coming in October and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">- 70 -</span>
November from districts which lie directly east or south-east of
Great Britain. Should our English winter prove generally
severe, or even partially so, our old birds will also leave, and in
their place we have an influx of old Blackbirds from the
Continent, pushed forward by similar causes. In the last
autumn and winter, which has been exceedingly variable, with
many sudden changes of temperature, our East Coast reports
show an enormous migration of this species to have taken place.
This commenced on September 12th, and was continued at
intervals throughout October, becoming nearly continuous in
November; after this intermittent, in throbs and pulsations, up
to the end of the third week in January, 1885. These influxes
of old birds correlate with sudden changes of temperature and
outbreaks of severe weather on the Continent. In the spring
the continental visitors disappear, and our so-called resident
Blackbirds come back to their nesting-quarters. In this way we
have a regular interchange of birds in the spring and autumn,&mdash;a
double migration, carried on twice a year between the British
Islands and the Continent. As far as our knowledge extends the
normal conditions of locality and climate over the whole area are
such as do not necessitate a regular interchange of the members
of their respective <i>avi-faunas</i>. There is apparently no reason
why our Rooks, Starlings, Sky Larks, and Blackbirds should not
be able to winter in England just as well as abroad; their not
doing so, but persistently migrating, is suggestive of a regular
succession of bird waves,&mdash;as one moves forward another quickly
follows in its wake. The southern limit of autumn migration,
in the individuals of any species, is in direct ratio to the
breeding range; such as nest in southern latitudes move still
further south, and thus make room for those of their sort which
have nested further north. Such are the ordinary phenomena
of migration, a movement which is as regular and persistent as
the flow and ebb of the tide.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> Migration is a voluntary, and not a compulsory, movement; and it
must not be imagined that recurring bird waves actually push each other
forward. Young Blackbirds and Thrushes leave some weeks in advance of
the great rush of their continental allies; and it is well known that
Woodcocks, which breed in Great Britain, leave in the autumn, before the
arrival of the northern flights, a distinct interval elapsing between the two
events&mdash;the going and the coming.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">- 71 -</span></p>

<p>One of the last schedules received, at the time of going to
press, from the Cockle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, off the Norfolk coast, records
immense flights of Crows (probably Rooks), passing in a southeasterly
direction to the Continent early in March, 1885,
commencing on the 2nd at 7 a.m., in large numbers on the 6th
at 6 a.m., and continuous from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. on the 8th;
large numbers again on the 9th at 5.30 a.m.</p>

<p>The notes under the head of separate species in the East
Coast report for 1884, indicate several movements of special
interest. Blackbirds, as has been already stated, have crossed
the North Sea in extraordinary numbers, commencing on
September 12th and throughout October, and immense numbers
in November; on the 11th, 12th and 13th the rush appears to
have been continuous, night, and day, over the whole coast line;
after this intermittent to the end of the third week in
January, 1885.</p>

<p>Another very interesting feature is the occurrence of the
Arctic Bluethroat in considerable numbers between September
8th and 16th; eighty to one hundred were observed in one
locality on the Norfolk coast on the 12th.</p>

<p>The migration of the Gold-crested Wren was very pronounced.
The first are recorded on August 28th, and after this at various
stations in large numbers up to November 22nd. Eighty-seven
days against ninety-two in 1882, and eighty-two in 1883. The
visible migration of this little wanderer across Heligoland has
been considerably below the average of other years.</p>

<p>Pied Flycatchers arrived in large numbers from August 10th
to September 17th. Across Heligoland also there was a great
migration between August 10th and <span class="correction">September 18th</span>.</p>

<p>Immense numbers of Bing Doves are shown to have crossed
from the Continent between the 21st of October and the end of
November. This immigration appears to have covered the coast
between Berwick and Yarmouth. On our northern coasts
for nine days, between November the 20th and 28th, the rush
was continuous. Large numbers of Stock Doves also crossed
during the same period.</p>

<p>The main body of the Woodcocks generally arrive in two
flights, known to East-coast sportsmen as the "first flight," and
after this the "great flight." In the autumn of 1884 the
immigration of this species was most prolonged, commencing on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">- 72 -</span>
September 1st, and continued onward to January 20th, 1885, or
142 days. Four distinct rushes or flights are also indicated,&mdash;October
5th and 6th; another on the 10th to the 16th; a third,
probably the "great flight," on the 28th; and again a very
large flight between November the 11th and 13th. Independent
of these there has been a constant dropping in by two or three
together, or singly, throughout the autumn and winter. Woodcocks
have also crossed Heligoland in the same desultory
fashion; and the dates of the chief flights will be found to
correlate closely with the rushes on to our East Coast.</p>

<p>In the latter part of November and early in December there
was a considerable arrival of Bitterns on the East Coast,
probably driven across by the severe weather on the Continent
between November the 28th and December 2nd.</p>

<p>Besides the Bluethroats, already noticed, several rare and
casual visitants have been recorded during the autumn. Two
examples of the Barred Warbler, one at Spurn Point and
another on the Norfolk coast. The Icterine Warbler, also on
the Norfolk coast; and an Ortolan Bunting, likewise from the
same locality. The Lapland Bunting, in Lincolnshire and
Norfolk; Tengmalm's Owl, in Holderness; and a rose-coloured
Starling, near Spurn.</p>

<p>Mr. G&auml;tke's Heligoland notes, from June 28th to the end of
the year, comprise 118 species, including, as usual, several rare
visitors to the ornithological observatory:&mdash;Icterine Warblers on
Aug. 18th; <i>Anthus richardi</i>, Sept. 3rd to Oct. 12th; <i>A. campestris</i>,
Sept. 4th; <i>Carpodacus erythrinus</i>, Sept. 9th; <i>Anthus cervinus</i>, a
great many, from Sept. 15th to Oct. 12th; <i>Lanius major</i>, in most
unusual numbers, from Sept. 17th to Nov. 4th; <i>Alauda cristata</i>,
Sept. 30th and Oct. 1st; <i>Saxicola stapazina</i> (?), Oct. 2nd; <i>Turdus
varius</i>, Oct. 3rd, 12th and 23rd, one each day; <i>Emberiza pusilla</i>,
Oct. 5th, two; <i>Turdus migratorius</i>, one on Oct. 14th; <i>Fringilla
rufescens</i>, our English Redpoll, one on Nov. 22nd. Besides
these large numbers of continental species, which are classed
amongst the rare and occasional visitants to the British Islands,
and whose line of migration is normally far to eastward of these
islands, as <i>Emberiza hortulana</i>, <i>Motacilla flava</i>, <i>M. alba</i>, <i>Sylvia
suecica</i>, <i>Anthus rupestris</i>, <i>Calcarius lapponicus</i>, <i>Otocorys alpestris</i>,
<i>Nyctala tengmalmi</i>, <i>Ruticilla titys</i>, <i>Regulus ignicapillus</i>, and
<i>Larus minutus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">- 73 -</span></p>

<p>The great rush of birds crossed Heligoland during the last
fortnight in October, and appears to have come directly across
to our eastern shores. Mr. G&auml;tke remarks, under date Oct. 24th,
S.E., clear, fine, early rather cold, <i>C. cornix</i>, <i>frugilegus</i>, and
<i>monedula</i>, monstrous numbers; <i>cornix</i> and <i>monedula</i> mixed in
uninterrupted flight of ten and twelve minutes each, continued
with but short interruptions or gaps; width as far as the eye
could reach in northerly and southerly directions; and thus
from 9 a.m. till 1 p.m. <i>Sturnus</i>, "a succession of clouds
sweeping past overhead."</p>

<p>Speaking generally of migration during the month of October,
"weather exceptionally fine; nearly no <i>curruca</i>; very few <i>rufa</i>;
few <i>rubecula</i>, <i>accentor</i>, <i>regulus</i>; and <i>fringilla</i> but small numbers.
Thrushes the same; not a single <i>Parus major</i> nor other Tits;
Pipits also far below the usual numbers."</p>

<p>"Marvellously many <i>Anthus cervinus</i>, <i>Lanius major</i> and
<i>excubitor</i>, and particularly <i>Corvid&aelig;</i> and Starlings. In December,
Greenfinches, enormous numbers all the month, more than ever
been seen here."</p>

<p>Since the completion of the Report Mr. J. H. Gurney informs
me that he has received from Mr. J. Barrett, of the Swin Middle
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, the wing of a Garganey Teal with the date July 22nd, 1884.
Dunlin, March 21st, 1885, and that of a Wheatear with the
extraordinary date of Feb. 4th attached.</p>

<p>From the Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> comes a schedule signed by Mr. T.
W. Harrison, the entries ranging from Nov. 10th, 1884, to
March 6th, 1885. On Nov. 10th about forty Carrion Crows
going from S.E. to N.W.; considerable numbers of Larks on
the nights of the 11th and 12th, about twenty being killed;
on the 13th, two Woodcocks at 6.40 p.m., N.N.E. <span class="correction">3</span>, misty, one
killed; the same night a great rush of Larks, Blackbirds,
Fieldfares and Starlings; "Black Crows" and Larks, also a few
Thrushes, at intervals through January, all coming from easterly
and going in westerly directions. On the night of Feb. 15th, E.,
Knot, Stint, Lapwing and other birds round the lantern all
night. Night of March 4th, E.S.E., Lapwings and Starlings
about lantern, and eight of the latter killed; on the night of the
5th, several Carrion Crows between 7 and 12 p.m., three killed.
The Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> is about thirty-five miles east of Skegness on
the Lincolnshire coast.</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison, at Cape Wrath, Bays birds are scarce at
this station: the coast being so wild they keep more inland.
Gamuts frequent the coast all the year from February to
November. The Peregrine Falcon is on the coast almost all the
year.</p>

<p>From Stoir Head Mr. Wither sends a few notes on land
birds. Arrival of Swallow noted May 11th, rather an early date
for the West Coast of Sutherland. Gannets were passing north
continuously in August.</p>

<p>Mr. Youngclause, after a long residence on the Monach Isles,
has removed to an E. Coast station, but sends a last schedule from
the former, dating March 30th to April 7th. Wrens seem scarce
here, and the Goldcrest he saw this year, but never on any
previous occasion. A robin had not been seen before for ten
years until April 7th, 1884. Snow Buntings on April 4th are
noted as unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. Youngclause adds "There has been a great scarcity of
birds at this station for a number of years back, and unless the
winds happen to be off the mainland, with hazy weather at the
time of migration, we scarcely see a bird. Even Eider Ducks
have deserted this place of late years, ever since we had the
fearful storm of Nov. 15th, 1877, but I am told they have been
very abundant about the Sound of Barra, and the sheltered
places on the east side of the island."</p>

<p>Mr. William Irvine sends two interesting schedules from
Barra Head. In September a continuous flight of birds flying
east is noticed on 6th, light S.E. wind.</p>

<p>From Rona Lighthouse the Goldcrest, a single bird, is
recorded in October as unusual, and is accurately described;
evidently of rare occurrence here.</p>

<p>I have to thank Mr. McCulloch, Kyleakin, for the careful
attention he has given to the subject of direction of flight in
every instance of a record, and, I may add, I am pleased to find
much more attention paid throughout the 1884 records to this
important item of our inquiries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">- 77 -</span></p>

<p><i>Skerryvore.</i>&mdash;Mr. Thomas Dawson sends full schedules from
February to December, but remarks, "Not one bird seen here
between Dec. 1st and Jan. 15th, date of latest schedule." The
only evidence of rushes was that of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>, in November,
correlating with E. coast rushes, but there are many light entries.
The same gale which detained a Blackbird on the rock also
detained Mr. Crow, the under light-keeper, twelve days after time
at Hynish Signal Tower. He and the Blackbird changed
residence on the same date.</p>

<p><i>Dhuheartach.</i>&mdash;Numerous light entries also from this station,
dating Dec. 2nd, by Mr. William Davidson.</p>

<p><i>Sound of Mull.</i>&mdash;Mr. William McLellan pays careful attention
to the directions of flight, and set of the tides and movements of
birds in connection therewith.</p>

<p><i>Rhuvaal.</i>&mdash;Mr. George Boreham also notes these important
particulars, and takes note of the rainfall in August&mdash;3rd to
25th&mdash;a new feature in our reports. He adds, "It is only very
rarely a bird strikes our lantern, as they keep well off shore when
passing on the wing."</p>

<p><i>M'Arthur's Head.</i>&mdash;Evidences of a rush of migrants, of
many species, are given in Oct. 7th, 8th, 9th, by Mr. W. Mail.
Wind prevailing S.W., but an E. gale on 9th, when "great
numbers" are recorded.</p>

<p><i>Skervuile.</i>&mdash;Mr. John Ewing sends well-filled schedules dating
Jan. 13th to Nov. 19th, giving many directions of flight. A
curious and interesting note is added. "On Oct. 5th" a "Sandpiper"
occurs. "This bird came to the rock five years ago,
when I succeeded in taming it, but I have not seen it since that
time till now."</p>

<p><i>Rhinns of Islay.</i>&mdash;Mr. Peter Anderson makes a very good
proposal indeed, and that is that our Committee ask the cooperation
of assistants as well as principals, as "by so doing
you will have a far better chance to get more notes; because, as at
present assistants care very little about recording their operations,
as they get no credit for doing so, whilst they have one-half of the
night on duty." Mr. Anderson anxiously desires a "small book
of plates of birds," and complains of the confusion connected
with local names in different parts. I have urged, and still urge,
on our Committee the advantage there would be in a printed list
of local names. For Scotland, the MS. is ready in my hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">- 78 -</span>
to be made useful as it stands, and there is abundant room for
enlargement; but it would cost somewhat to print and distribute
it. I have three excellent schedules from Mr. Anderson. I
think his proposals are worthy of the attention both of our
Committee and of the British Association. Mr. Ross has also
materially assisted Mr. Anderson in filling these up. We would
be glad to receive from all stations the names of <i>all the assistant
keepers</i>, which can be inserted in next return of schedules. A
very pronounced rush is recorded at this station. It is quite
a principal station on our W. coast.</p>

<p><i>Lamlash, Arran.</i>&mdash;Mr. David M. Scott does not consider it
necessary to mention all occurrences of Herons at this station,
"as they breed on the high rocks on the Island, and, of course,
are always in the locality."</p>

<p><i>Turnberry.</i>&mdash;From February to December almost all records
are accompanied by winds from S.S.E., S. or E. We have
records on twenty-one dates in that time, and only on one
day (Nov. 19th) is the wind out of another quarter, <i>viz.</i> N.N.W.;
on this date a solitary Redshank was killed at the lantern.</p>

<p><i>Corsewall.</i>&mdash;Rushes evident both in spring and autumn.
Winds on dates of heaviest records S. to E. and N.E., but
also heavy returns on Sept. 22nd, with fresh S.W. and haze.
Dates of rushes very marked. A short but largely bulking
schedule.</p>

<p><i>Mull of Galloway.</i>&mdash;The migration is, on the whole, more
distinctly shown in October on the West Coast south of the
Clyde than on the East Coast at Isle of May during October.
The direction of flight usually given is, where noticed, S.E.
While on the East Coast, at Isle of May, winds were north of
either E. or W. between Sept. 26th and Oct. 17th, on the
West Coast south of Clyde they were S. and W. light. The
coast lines in the W. thus showed their influence on the migration;
and the normal winds, being west on the West Coast,
developed a larger and steadier visible migration than on the
East Coast. The only Woodcock recorded at this station in
October&mdash;Oct. 19th&mdash;came during strong N. breeze. A considerable
number of Swallows occurred between June 29th and
July 4th, when there was a rush. I have no returns from the
Mull of Galloway after Oct. 23rd.</p>

<p><i>Little Ross.</i>&mdash;Considerable evidence of rushes in latter end of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">- 79 -</span>
October and in November. Mr. James Ferrier says, "Since the
above dates&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, plates of last schedule, 18th Nov. to 24th
Dec.&mdash;there have been no birds." ... "No day migration
observed here."</p>

<p><i>Langness, Isle of Man.</i>&mdash;Mr. Robt. Clyne, formerly under-keeper
at Isle of May, writes that he considers the great flights of
Linnets&mdash;grey and green&mdash;are all local, and also Starlings, and he
thinks they need hardly be mentioned in the schedules, in the
meantime. A very large congregation of Green Linnets took
place at Langness on Nov. 19th, which must be noticed in
connection with our records elsewhere, on both E. and W.
coasts (J. A. H. B.),&mdash;probably about 500 to 600, Mr. Clyne
says. The Committee marvels very much what can have become
of their late coadjutor Mr. Philip M. Kermode. He has not, to
Mr. Clyne's knowledge, as yet paid him a visit. Mr. Clyne
mentions the abundance of Red-legged Crows. He had entered
them as "Jackdaws," but subsequently has become aware of the
error. They are numerous about Castletown. Very little fog
has been experienced, and the fog-signal has only been once
used in the past two months (<i>in lit.</i> Nov. 24th). The Committee
are much obliged to Mr. Clyne for his interesting and well-filled
schedules. He gave some interesting notes also on the species
breeding around the station.</p>

<p id="Chickens_Rock"><i>Chickens Rock, Isle of Man.</i>&mdash;A very heavy rush is recorded
between 15th Oct. and 21st to 26th, "the flocks being so dense
that no approximate number could be given; they formed by far
the most numerous flocks of migrants seen this season" (James
Black, principal keeper). We were singularly unfortunate at the
Isle of May, the winds there being N. of E. or W.; while here,
in the Isle of Man, they were, during the heaviest filled dates,
15th and 21st Nov., strong W. and haze, the migrants crossing
the wind, and showing largely at these more southerly stations
of our West Coast.</p>

<p>To Mr. M'Iver, Teacher at Culken, in Assynt, Sutherland, I
am obliged for some land notes of interest, which will appear
under the various species in connection with Stoir Head
Lighthouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">- 80 -</span></p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Report under Species.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;While in 1883, Spring migration almost escaped
notice on the West Coast, in 1884 a rush was very evident
between the 18th and 20th Feb., at stations south of Clyde, such
as at Corsewall, and indications of same movement north of
Clyde, at Skerryvore; but most records south of Clyde. Doubtless
Isle of Man could also testify to this, but we have no
schedules thence till date of July 20th, when Mr. Clyne went
there. There are also a few movements in March at
Skerryvore and Skervuile. In both months winds light
S.S.E. or S.E. In autumn, much greater than on the East
coast. Every station from Cape Rhu Stoir, south, gave
movements, as follows:&mdash;Rhu Stoir (slight), Barra Head
(six seen, 19th Nov.), Rona (light, and only in July),
Kyleakin (light indication, 15th Nov.), Skerryvore (a number,
12th, 15th and 16th Nov.), Dhuheartach (light, 15th, 16th to
24th Oct., a few as early as 4th July and 1st Aug., probably
local), Sound of Mull (few only, on 19th Sept. and 19th Dec.),
Skervuile (light, in November), Rhinns of Islay (enormous rush
of Redwings, Thrushes, Fieldfares, Blackbirds, with Woodcocks,
Larks, Crows, 14th to 19th Nov.), and southwards, at Lamlash,
Arran (good indication on 10th), at Corsewall (a rush on 10th),
at Mull of Galloway (rushes, between 10th and 13th and 23rd),
and at Little Ross (mostly of Blackbirds). Winds, north of
Clyde, in October northerly and westerly, and in November
southerly and easterly; for the most part returns lighter in
October than in November, and great rushes in November at
stations south of Clyde, where winds, during latter half of
October and November, were S. and easterly. Great rushes all
this time, correlating with East Coast of England, but not so
much observed on East Coast of Scotland, owing to winds then
being N., and never S., of E. or W. The species mentioned are
for the most part Thrushes and Blackbirds, Fieldfares and Red-wings,
but there is reason to believe that the latter really bulk
largely in the migration, as where the bird is distinguished from
the Thrush or Mavis they appear to have come in numbers,, as
at Isle of Man (R. Clyne) and Rhinns of Islay (Peter Anderson and
Wm. Ross). The migration extended over a considerable time;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">- 81 -</span>
yet the rushes were remarkable for intensity and uniformity in
time at the various stations. The earliest record given is at
Dhuheartach (July 4th), but may have been a local movement,
along with two other summer records. Next in August (1st, 10th
and 28th, a few). Actual first migration in mass commencing
Sept. 19th, 21st, and 25th at Sound of Mull, M'Arthur's Head,
and Corsewall, respectively. The latest records reaching me date
Dec. 19th, at Sound of Mull,&mdash;a solitary Blackbird; and by the
19th Nov. the body of the rush was past, the latest record being
on that date at Rhinns of Islay. The rush was strictly defined,
and there are not many full records before the last week in
October. The earliest species recorded (excluding July) is
Thrush, and the next Fieldfares, at Skervuile. The latest
species recorded are Blackbirds, at Sound of Mull. Those
species which bulk largest are Blackbirds and Thrushes; and
those least, Fieldfares. Redwings are probably more numerous
than actually recorded, as all our reporters do not perhaps
distinguish them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Note.</i>&mdash;For all purposes of this Report, "Stonechats"
and Wheatears are identical. Where true Stonechats are
recognised and mentioned, the records relating to these are kept
distinct. In Spring: earliest Wheatears at Sound of Mull (29th
March); latest, single bird at Skerryvore, 14th May, and one
on 11th; appearance of rush at Skerryvore on 22nd, twelve birds
at the lantern, fresh S., haze; and at Skervuile indications on
22nd to 24th, light E. and S.E. In Autumn: earliest at Isle of
Man stations, 2nd, 9th, and 10th Aug.; almost a rush on 10th
at Chickens Rock; and several, 9th and 10th, at Langness.
[<i>Note.</i>&mdash;Chickens Rock reporter calls them "Stonechats," but
Langness reporter correctly terms them "Wheatears."] Then at
Rhu Stoir, in the north, comes the next earliest date, 16th Aug.
Thereafter stations returning them are Rhu Stoir, Skerryvore,
Dhuheartach, Skervuile, Chickens Rock, and Langness. Bush
appears most decided at the early dates at Isle of Man; and
again between 20th and 24th Aug. at Dhuheartach, N. of Clyde,
and at Skervuile; whilst a third considerable movement is
noticeable on 15th and 26th Sept., at Isle of Man. The latter is
also the latest date on record. Besides Wheatears we have the
following records of true Stonechats (Stonechat, Pratincola
rubicola). Earliest at Dhuheartach, August; and at Skervuile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">- 82 -</span>
between 20th and 26th, accompanying rush of the last species.
Of Redstarts only one record; and two or three at Langness on
8th Sept. Winds in August at most localities, S., S.E. and
S.W., light or fresh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring only one record, <i>viz.</i>, Robin; one, at
Monach Isles, on 7th April, S.E., clear; and a rush at
Corsewall on 29th March. In autumn: earliest at Kyleakin,
24th Aug., light S. (Two previous records on 19th and 28th
July at Rona, Skye, are in the debatable ground between local
and general migration.) In September two single records only,
at Sound of Mull and M'Arthur's Head, both on 19th, at which
latter station it is reported as "arriving in winter." One
Blackcap, female, sent me for identification from Skerryvore, on
16th Nov., moderate N.E., haze, completes our records of this
group.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;</span>, Gold-crested Wren.&mdash;Evident rush noticeable
in spring, when great numbers, along with the Robins, were
seen at Corsewall on 29th March. One bird occurred at Monach
Isles, "new to Mr. Youngclause," but accurately described,
therefore hitherto rare at that station; and one is recorded from
Rona Skye, but no date given. In autumn a considerable
migration, beginning with the earliest at Sound of Mull, on
28th Aug., strong S., with showers. Ending with latest at
Lamlash, on 16th Nov., a single bird. (Note here the exactness
of how even single records on West coast agree with movements
on the East coast.) Scattered records occur at Lamlash, Firth
of Clyde, and at Corsewall, between 10th and 19th Sept.;
almost a rush on latter dates. Rush on 24th at Little Ross, and
indications of ditto at Langness, on 17th and 18th; desultory
records at Little Ross before these dates, 11th to 22nd. In
October evidence of rushes on night of the total eclipse of the
moon, <i>viz.</i>, 4th Oct., between the same hours, 9 and 12 midnight,
the hours of total eclipse of greatest darkness, just as was
observed by Mr. Geo. E. Paterson and myself at Isle of May, on
the East coast; another indication of a rush, between Oct. 19th
and 23rd, at Mull of Galloway. Only single records at
Dhuheartach, Skervuile, and Lamlash in November; but, as
before remarked, these single records marvellously coincide with
East Coast records, and are therefore important. Wind at stations
returning, mostly light and various, W., E., and S. Night of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">- 83 -</span>
eclipse, light W., cloudy and dark. Of Willow Warblers, a few
on 10th and 11th Sept., at Little Ross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;No records either spring or autumn. The
negative evidence is worth positive record.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Two records only. At Mull, of Galloway, on Sept.
10th, two Titmice, in strong S. wind at lantern, and at Sound of
Mull, two struck, but not killed, on Oct. 30th, light S.W. How
far these are only local movements or not, it is difficult to know
with the small data yet to hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;On March 30th, one Common Wren returned
in schedule from Monach Isles. Fresh south haze. It would
be interesting to know the original starting place of this solitary
Wren. The newly-discovered insular variety of St. Kilda is,
however, probably entirely resident there all winter. Nevertheless
we would like specimens of Wrens from Monach Isles at all
seasons for examination. In September, one occurred at
Lismore, sitting on rock, on 22nd, light N.E. wind and haze.
In October a single bird at Rhu Stoir, at noon, strong S. and
rain, and three occurred at Lamlash on Nov. 4th, flying south
against a strong S.W. wind and showers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Only spring record of Wagtails on May 11th
two males and two females at Rhu Stoir. In autumn, earliest Aug.
27th, at Skerryvore, when one remained three days on the rock,
indicating thus the correlating rush on 31st at Langness, where
about a hundred in a large flock of young Pied Wagtails were
seen all day. These are called "Grey Wagtails or young Pied
Wagtails" by Mr. Clyne. The true Grey Wagtail is a yellow
bird with a black throat and very long tail. [Surely British
ornithologists can find a more descriptive and truer name than
Grey Wagtail for <i>Motacilla boarula</i>. If confusion occurs amongst
ordinary observers as to names, it is as often the fault of the
naturalists who misapplied the names in the first instance as
not.] In September a further rush of the same young Pied
Wagtails observable on the 10th at Langness&mdash;a flock seen&mdash;and
a dozen at Rhinns of Islay on 7th; and a few at Barra
Head and one at Dhuheartach on Sept. 1st. In October a few
at Langness, on the 6th, the latest given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;</span>, Pipits.&mdash;Earliest Meadow Pipit in spring,
single records on 8th and 21st, at Skerryvore, light S.E. haze
and fresh N.W. clear respectively. One rested on lantern of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">- 84 -</span>
Lamlash Light on May 2nd. In autumn, the rush of Meadow
Pipits took place at Isle of Man&mdash;Langness during Sept. 4th
(a lot), 9th (very many), 24th (large flock), 29th (large flock).
Earliest, August 31st (large flock). Later, a few in October at
Skerryvore, on 6th and 16th, fresh S.W. breeze, and at same
station on 1st and 12th Nov., fresh S.W., rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muscicapid&aelig;</span>, Flycatchers.&mdash;Only one record at Longness
(R. Clyne), the first record in six years' observation, on Sept.
11th. Mr. Clyne has met with the Pied Flycatcher on Isle of
May, as well as the Spotted, but these two seen on Isle of Man
are only designated "Flycatchers." As the Pied Flycatcher
breeds in Cumberland and N. of England, it would be interesting
to know which species (or if both) visits Isle of Man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinid&aelig;</span>, Swallows.&mdash;Dates of arrivals are as follows:&mdash;March
30th, at Corsewall. It is worthy of note that I observed a
Swallow at Glendoune Girvan hawking for insects as late in
autumn of 1884 as Nov. 8th (see <a href="#EAST_COAST_OF_SCOTLAND">East Coast Report</a>). May 11th,
three seen at Rhu Stoir (an early arrival for Sutherland W.
coast, J. A. H. B.), light south, one seen at Skerryvore, light S.E.;
17th, one at Skerryvore, fresh, S.W.; 14th, three at Lamlash;
19th, several all day at Rhinns of Islay, light S.E., haze; 21st,
one seen at Rhu Stoir, light S.; 22nd, two Sand Martins at
Barra Head; June 3rd and 4th, two Sand Martins at Barra
Head, light N., cloudy; 19th, two Swallows at Kyleakin, flying
S., light S. and clear; 22nd, one Swallow at Rhu Stoir, light
fog and rain; 29th, great numbers (rush) flying around at Mull
of Galloway, and ditto flying E. at same place on 30th; and on
30th one seen at Cape Wrath; in July, eight Swallows on 3rd
and "scores" on 4th (probably local at Mull of Galloway,
preparing for departure); one at Langness on. 25th; in August,
flock at Langness of Swallows on 20th, and another on 25th;
in September, several on 5th, at Langness, and on 8th and
10th, and single records at same place, and at Rhinns of
Islay on 29th and 30th; in October, a large flock of Swallows
and a party of twelve at Langness, and a flock at Chickens
Rock on 6th; a flock of twelve on 19th at Langness, the
latest record.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fringillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Very few returns in spring. A few Grey
Linnets on May 12th at Skervuile, and a few at Rona, Skye, on
26th, being all. In autumn, a rush, and earliest record save
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">- 85 -</span>
one, at Rhuvaal, of young Grey Linnets flying W. on Aug. 20th,
and a few same day at Skervuile. The earliest date is a flock at
Isle of Man (Langness) on July 29th. Latest record on Nov.
19th of Green Linnets, a rush of 700 or 800, and rushes between
4th and 19th, all at Langness. Bushes during latter end of
October at Langness, and sufficient indications at several stations
N. of Clyde, as Kyleakin, Skervuile, and Rhinns of Islay. This
species bulks largest in all the schedules. Other species noticed
are Sparrows (large flock at Langness, Oct. 13th); "Mountain
Sparrow" (true Tree Sparrow), one at Rhinns of Islay; "Small
Linnets" (Twites or Redpoles?) at Rhinns of Islay, Oct. 21st;
Chaffinch, a few stray entries at Dhuheartach, one found dead
on rock on Nov. 2nd, others seen on 17th and 19th (male), and
a flock at Langness on Oct. 3rd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizid&aelig;</span>, Buntings.&mdash;Snow Buntings in spring, 203 on
14th to 17th March at Barra Head; a large flock at Rhu Stoir
on 16th, and one female, same place, on 24th; flock at Monach
Isles April 4th; one female at Rhu Stoir as late as June 2nd,
fresh various rain. In autumn, records light everywhere. One
in October only at Barra Head; ten on Nov. 2nd at Cape
Wrath; ten on 7th at Barra Head; odd birds at Skerryvore and
Dhuheartach on 16th, and an apparent rush or local flight of
fifty on Island at Rhinns of Islay on 14th, and a number (with
Thrushes) on 16th at same place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alaudid&aelig;</span>, Larks.&mdash;Autumn migration of 1883-4 continued
with some force into January, 1884, especially noted at
Kyleakin, or these may have been local flights. In spring,
Larks occur sparingly at same time as Thrushes and Starlings.
Feb. 1st, at Lamlash, and Feb. 19th at Skerryvore; also nine
(three killed) at latter station March 10th; no more till June
15th; "Larks" at Skervuile, and four on 29th at Dhuheartach.
In July, four at Dhuheartach. In autumn, earliest record at
Dhuheartach on Aug. 1st, the only record that month; then
only a single bird all September, on 21st, at Langness. Latest
record, October 24th, a few at Rhinns of Islay. The rush was
very great, and took place between the 14th and 21st October,
or perhaps more compressed still between the 14th and 19th
Oct. The whole duration of time in which Larks migrated is
thus very limited this season, <i>viz.</i>, between Oct. 14th and Oct.
24th, the latest date given. During the rush, which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">- 86 -</span>
observable principally at Rhinns of Islay, north of Clyde, the
wind was northerly or north-westerly, the same as on the East
Coast at the same dates, which accounts for the body of the
rush penetrating more to the north and reaching further than in
other winds. At Rhinns of Islay hundreds, and on 19th
thousands were seen, wind fresh W. to N.W. All flying west.
On the East Coast the winds favourable to their continued flight
prevented my observing them in any great numbers at Isle of
May, but there can scarcely be any doubt these great flights
passed up the Firth of Forth, as we had plentiful opportunities
of seeing almost continuous indications of their presence at the
above dates on the Isle of May. The stations returning Larks
are Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, and Rhinns of Islay, and Langness
(only a small record on Oct. 2nd). Query, will our Irish
Coast returns show the continuance of this flight of Larks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturnin&aelig;</span>, Starlings.&mdash;Spring, rare indications at Rhu Stoir,
March 25th (probably local), one female, and at Lamlash, one
on April 1st, and March 2nd one killed, and at Corsewall on
Feb. 19th, struck along with Thrushes and Larks. The latter
record may have been an indication of real migration, the others
are most likely local only. In autumn, earliest Aug. 12th, at
Isle of Man, a flock; on 23rd, a number at Rhinns of Islay,
culminating in hundreds and hundreds on August 30th at
Langness (Isle of Man), and again in hundreds and hundreds
at Langness Sept. 18th, and indication by a flock at Mull of
Galloway. Again, in October, rushes evident it may be said
between 18th and 23rd, and on 29th, observable at Kyleakin (on
18th), at Mull of Galloway on 22nd and 23rd, "flocks," and
on 29th by 200 or 300 at Rhinns of Islay. Another rush along
with Thrushes, &amp;c., dating Nov. 14th, at Rhinns of Islay.
Indications of movements also at Kyleakin and Dhuheartach
on Nov. 1st and 2nd. Latest, a solitary record on Dec. 24th
at Lamlash. Migration of this species we may designate in
1884 as short, sharp and decisive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvid&aelig;</span>, Crows.&mdash;Spring: movement of Carrion Crows,
Ravens and Rooks few, and only in February and March. In
February, "Black Crows" at Barra Head, one on 23rd, and
fifteen on 14th and 15th, fresh S.E. and strong E.; also
Carrion Crows at Skerryvore (three, "very seldom seen") flying
around, fresh S. clear. Ravens, two at Cape Wrath (probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">- 87 -</span>
breeding in the neighbourhood, at Craig Riabhach), light S.W.
haze; and one at Skerryvore flying N.E. Rooks at Rhu Stoir,
probably belonging to one of two rookeries in N. and W. of
Sutherland, <i>viz.</i>, at Cama Loch in W. Cromarty, or at Tongue.
In autumn, from 1st to 25th Aug., a very large flock, mostly
young, feeding daily around Rhu Stoir (probably a local visitation
from Cama Loch or Tongue), but Tongue Rooks are known
to feed, regularly in winter at Far-out Head in the neighbourhood
of Durness, and in severe winters are seen going there
and returning in evening. The Rhu Stoir birds are therefore
more likely to belong to the Cama Loch rookery. At Chickens
Rock, Isle of Man, a number of Rooks flying W. towards
Ireland on 11th August. No records in September. In October,
Hooded and Carrion Crows flying W.S.W. for Ireland at Rhinns
of Islay, and a few seen for days at Langness, feeding, about
the same time. Records continue to increase in November, a
rush of hundreds and thousands at Rhinns of Islay by 13th,
continuing in force up to 17th and 18th, flying east on 13th,
but resting or flying S.W. on 17th and 18th, along with
enormous rush of Curlews, Woodcocks, Snipe, Sandpipers,
Larks, Redwings, Thrushes, Starlings, Blackbirds, and a few
Jacksnipes. Latest record on 19th. Also Ravens same dates, a
few, and Jackdaws on 16th and 1st Dec. at Skerryvore and
Dhuheartach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cypselid&aelig;</span>, Swifts.&mdash;On July 20th, about twenty flying S.,
strong E., rain and haze, at Skervuile, and at same station a
few along with Swallows, light E. and clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuculid&aelig;</span>, Cuckoo.&mdash;In spring, arrivals as follows:&mdash;At
Rona Skye, May 11th, first heard, light S.W. Kyleakin, May
10th, first heard, moderate S.S.W., haze. Sound of Mull,
May 8th, first heard, moderate S.W., clear. Skervuile, May
10th, first seen, light E. Rhinns of Islay, May 19th, first
seen, fresh E., clear. Lamlash, May 12th, first heard. Corsewall,
May 11th, first heard. Autumn, Barra Head, June 28th,
1 first seen. Mull of Galloway, 1 first seen in July. Autumn
records of Cuckoos scarce during six years' records.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strigid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring, April 28th, one Brown Owl for three
days at Skerryvore; and 1 Owl in May (probably Short-eared
Owl) at Dhuheartach. No autumn records.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falconid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At Skerryvore, one Sparrow Hawk on 29th.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">- 88 -</span>
At Cape Wrath, Game Falcon and a "Small Hawk" (Merlin?)
on the coast all the year round. In autumn, fewer records than
usual on predatory visits. One Falcon on Aug. 28th at Rhuvaal.
Sparrow Hawk on 1st, and again on 19th, at Skerryvore; one
on Oct. 15th and 16th at Dhuheartach; and one Sparrow Hawk
resting on sun-dial on 9th. One Eagle seen at Erraid ("rarely
seen here") in November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelicanid&aelig;</span>, Gannet.&mdash;Records in order of dates:&mdash;At
Skervuile, March 10th, one flying S., fresh S.E.; 14th, one
flying N., S. gale. Rhu Stoir, April 25th, five fishing, light
S.E., clear. Skervuile, April 16th, one flying N. (local?).
Rona, May 25th, twelve, W. clear; 29th, one, strong N., clear.
Kyleakin, June 20th, in flock flying E., E. clear. Lismore,
22nd, flying S., various, light, clear. Dhuheartach, July 4th,
one; 20th, flying S. Skervuile, 6th and 7th, Solans flying S.;
23rd and 24th, Solans flying S. Little Ross, July 9th, three
flying W. from the Solway. At Rhu Stoir, Aug. 28th, rush,
and passed daily in flocks flying N. up to the middle of August
(see directions of flight at Pentland Skerries, E. Coast). During
the rest of August, 24th to 30th, records are given from Rhuvaal,
Skervuile, and Lamlash and Little Ross, but directions of flight
are omitted under the dates given (see records off Cape St.
Vincent). In September, a flock flying W. at Langness on
21st, a single bird flying N. at Barra Head, and two flying S.E.
on 6th; and a late record at Lamlash on Nov. 6th (marked
"late").</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;</span>, Ducks, Geese, Swans.&mdash;Spring records of "Wild
Geese" are six flying S.E., wind E. and snow, at Kyleakin
(local), and two on March 23rd flying S.W. In April, 17th and
21st, two or three flying W. and flying S. Autumn ditto of
Wild Geese, numerous. Earliest, Aug. 21st, flying S., at
Kyleakin. Latest, Dec. 9th, six flying S. at Lamlash. Other
records in Oct., but no rush evident. Of Eider Ducks there are
many records. Earliest at Rhinns of Islay, seventeen males and
females on Aug. 6th. Latest December 14th, seven males and
seven females flying S. on 3rd, and six on 22nd at Rhinns of
Islay. Greatest numbers seen at Rhinns of Islay Oct. 29th,
when at least 200 were seen at 7 a.m., and 100 at 9 a.m. In
November the "first seen this fall" at Skerryvore on 1st,
and large flock on 6th flying S., and others at Dhuheartach.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">- 89 -</span>
Other species are Sheldrakes (breeding at Rona), arrived in
May; Barnacle Geese, thirteen at Barra Head on Oct. 13th,
resting. Wigeon, one female, at Rhinns of Islay, on Aug. 23rd.
Of Swans, two flying N., seen at Sound of Mull on June 2nd, with
light N.W. airs. Barnacle Geese identified by head sent me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columbid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Two Rock Doves flying S. (local) at Kyleakin,
and six Wood Pigeons at same place on 22nd, flying S.S.W.,
moderate S. wind. In August, five doves flying E. at Rhuvaal;
and in December, at Rhinns of Islay, 300 flying south, about one
mile inland, light W., haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rallin&aelig;</span>, Corn Crakes, Water Rails, &amp;c.&mdash;Only spring
record: a Corn Crake at Barra Head on 6th June. Only autumn
records: one killed at lantern of Mull of Galloway, and one Water
Rail killed at Rhinns of Islay (sent to me in the skin, J. A. H. B.)
on 23rd October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charadriad&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Large flocks of Golden Plover arrive on the
coast around Rhu Stoir during winter, when snow lies inland,
and are seen onwards after March 12th and 15th, 1884, at
same station. In autumn, records of Golden Plover unusually
scarce; single ones at Sound of Mull, Sept. 19th, and Rhinns of
Islay, Sept. 18th. Large flocks begin to arrive at Rhu Stoir
("to come towards the shore ") early in November, remain all
winter. At Rhinns of Islay, two "Gray Plovers," marked
"rare," seen on Oct. 6th. Usual records of Oystercatchers,
not so abundant or general as usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lapwings.</span>&mdash;One seen Feb. 15th at Barra Head; twenty on
March 15th at Rhu Stoir, and one or two single ones there on
7th and 11th; and two on April 2nd. No great movement
recorded in autumn. Rhinns of Islay, 10 flying about on 24th
August and seven resting at Barra Head on 7th October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scolopacid&aelig;</span>, Woodcock, Snipe, Curlew, Whimbrel.&mdash;Woodcock:
Earliest in autumn, Oct. 9th, one shot at Mull of
Galloway. Latest, Nov. 18th, one at Dhuheartach, resting.
Indication of more general movement between 15th, 16th, to
23rd Oct., but very slight, at Barra Head, one on 19th at
Skervuile, Rhinns of Islay, and at Dhuheartach. Snipe: Only
some three records; in September one at Skerryvore, in October
one at Dhuheartach, and in August two at Rhinns of Islay,
killed. Curlews: Numerous records from July on to November
at many stations. Whimbrel: One noticed at Langness in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">- 90 -</span>
August. A few records of Sandpipers (see notes under stations
at Skervuile.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sternin&aelig;</span>, Terns.&mdash;Arrivals in spring: At Rona, a rush of
200 arrived on May 11th, light S.W. and clear. At Skervuile,
one first seen on May 23rd, calm; a number arrived between
24th and 31st, light, various. At Kyleakin, Terns first seen
26th June, strong S. At M'Arthur's Head, Terns first seen 18th
June. At Rhinns of Islay, Terns first seen 23rd and 24th July,
light S.W. Query, return Journey? In autumn: Terns seen
11th and 12th at Skervuile; and more on 18th; and at Chickens
Rock large quantities flying north on August 8th. Last seen
at Kyleakin on September 6th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Considerable movements of Gulls of sorts from
July 5th on to winter. Black-headed Gulls are marked as
"very few this year" at Skervuile. Continuous flocks flew E.
past Barra Head on Sept. 6th. Continuous flocks flew N.W.
past Sound of Mull in August. Skervuile returns "numbers"
about the middle of August. At one station, <i>viz.</i>, Skervuile,
the following are their recorded movements: in variable but
prevailing N. to N.W. winds till Nov. 17th; thereafter light
N.E. In August: 19th, one Boatswain Gull; 26th, flock of
Herring Gulls; 31st, flock of Gulls. September, two records of
flock of Terns, and Kittiwakes. Oct. 16th and 17th, ditto, ditto.
November, on three dates Boatswain Birds and Kittiwakes.
At Stoir Head vast flocks of Common Gulls and Herring
Gulls passed N. Herrings "set into" Lochs Coul and Dhu,
a little to the north of this, about this time, December, 1884,
which locally accounts for this rush. Most of the Common
Gulls were young. At Rhinns of Islay two "one-year-old
Iceland Gulls" with hundreds of other Gulls flying about.
We are particular in recording Gull returns, as this was an
extraordinary Gull year on the East Coast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Procellariid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;On July 26th one Storm Petrel on lantern
at Barra Head, the earliest record of any for six years, light E.
with fog. One ditto at Stoir Head (rare) in August, and one on
Sept. 3rd at Lismore (also rare), killed, light N.W., haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcid&aelig;</span>, Razorbills, Guillemots, Puffins.&mdash;On Feb. 23rd,
increased from 20th to date at Barra Head. "Marrots" and
Razorbills, all March 6th to 8th, 14th to 17th, 23rd to 24th
and 29th, winds light S.E. and S.W. In April: 4th to 11th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">- 91 -</span>
rush at Barra Head, various, N.E., clear, and Puffins; a few
on 9th; 17th to 22nd, a few only of Marrots and Razorbills
seen. On May 6th and 7th, Puffins, Razorbills and Marrots
(Marrot or Guillemot) arrived in great numbers; and at
Kyleakin two Tysties (<i>i.e.</i> Black Guillemots) seen flying S.E.
In autumn, all left Barra Head except a few by Aug. 20th,
but reappeared for a day on 30th, on which day all the
Puffins left, light S.W. In October, continuous flocks of
Puffins flying S. before a north gale at Rhinns of Islay, on
October 12th.</p>

<p>Were Bell Rock also a <i>fixed white light</i>, no doubt returns
would be equally extensive, or greater, possibly, than Isle of
May. The white fixed lights have superiority; and when this
is combined with low height over the sea and insular position,
the best conditions appear, and are only to be beaten by floating
light-ships. The flash lights have little chance to compete.</p>

<p><i>Revolving</i> lights, whatever the height, yield fewer returns
than <i>fixed</i>, but are better than flash or red sectors.</p>

<p>We also thank those who, situated at still less likely stations,
have nevertheless taken an interest in our work.</p>

<p><i>Bressay</i> sends one year's return (1882); 105 feet; red and
white, revolving every minute.</p>

<p><i>Ross Head.</i>&mdash;One year (1883), A. Greig; 175 feet; white and
red revolving, every half minute.</p>

<p><i>Kinnaird Head.</i>&mdash;One year (1884); a blank schedule, valuable
on negative grounds; 120 feet; white and red sectors, fixed.</p>

<p><i>Girdleness.</i>&mdash;Two years (1880 and 1884); 185 feet; white
fixed. Thomas Gallie and J. McAlister. The situation is said
to be unfavourable, apart from light or altitude.</p>

<p>Finally, taking the remaining lights which have returned no
years schedules, we will analyse their positions, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Start Point.</i>&mdash;80 feet; red, fixed. Class V.</p>

<p><i>Hoy Sound.</i>&mdash;(55 and 115). Low, white, fixed, facing N.
High ditto; red and white sectors, fixed. V.</p>

<p><i>Cantick Head.</i>&mdash;115 feet; white, revolving every minute.</p>

<p><i>Holborn Head.</i>&mdash;75 feet; white and red flash, 10 seconds,
facing N. V.</p>

<p><i>Tarbat Ness.</i>&mdash;175 feet; white intermittent, 2&frac12; minutes. It is
not quite clear to me yet why this station should not yield
returns (see <a href="#station_map">map</a>), unless it be considered partially land-locked
from E. and S.E.</p>

<p><i>Buchan Ness.</i>&mdash;130 feet; white flash, every 5 seconds; and
close to fishing village.</p>

<p><i>Montroseness.</i>&mdash;124 feet; white, fixed; but amongst houses. V.</p>

<p>We think the above analysis places almost beyond doubt
that the best position for a lights to attract birds is in a light
ship (witness the E. English Coast returns); next, an island of
low elevation; next, an island of considerable elevation, if facing
east, not if facing north; and that the worst are those at high
elevations, and especially if facing otherwise than E., on the
East Coast, or on East Coast Islands, or those in midst of
towns, or in land-locked situations; that the best description
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">- 93 -</span>
of light is "white, fixed,"&mdash;in fact, the brightest. Thus in
many instances we consider that it is owing to position and
nature of lights to a very considerable extent that we receive
more schedules from some stations than others, and none at
all from the least likely, whereas on the English East Coast
all light-ships are almost equally good as regards position.</p>

<p>Yet we do not allow that this is entirely the cause of least
and greatest migration at different points, because we now know
well enough, from land data, that certain tracks are preferred to
others, and that these tracks over land have very strong connection
with the East Coast Scotch principal stations, as we think
our Reports will show.</p>

<p>As regards the influences of winds, &amp;c., sufficient has already
been said on this head throughout the Reports, and every
succeeding schedule goes to prove our previous ones.</p>

<p>Analyses of the West Coast schedules almost always show
much lighter returns than those from the East Coast, even from
the best West Coast stations. Our previous five years' experience
in great measure explains why it is so, and it seems natural to
expect lighter returns on the West than on the East in most
winds or weather. But, having regard to the said experience
and the facts of migration which may now be said to be
ascertained and certain, there are also one or two additional
causes for the light nature of West Coast returns as against
East Coast ones; while on the latter, the lights which give
the greatest illumination, if in other respects suitably exposed,
give the heaviest returns; on the former, it seems that the
positions of the various stations have more to do with these.
Thus most of the East Coast stations face the east, whence
come the birds naturally, and while on the west birds travel
from N.W. towards S. or S.E., the extraordinary variety of
situations, and the equally great&mdash;or nearly so&mdash;variety of
lights of no great power and brilliancy, must undoubtedly
influence the quantities of birds visible on migration. And
we find that while such stations as Kyleakin (white and red,
fixed), Isle Ornsay (white, fixed), Sound of Mull (red, green,
and white sectors), Corran Ferry (red and white sectors,
fixed), &amp;c., give small returns, or none at all, this is resultant
upon their positions even more than their brilliancy or absence
of brilliancy. And we find that the best situated stations, such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">- 94 -</span>
as Monach Isle (though only upper white flash, and lower, red
fixed) gives better, though uncertain, returns, and Skerryvore
(white revolving) and Dhuheartach (white and red sector, fixed),
and Rhinns of Islay (white flash every five seconds) seem to be
the surest stations north of Clyde. Indeed it is, perhaps,
almost certain that most of the land-locked stations of the West
Coast should be marked with the symbol of lowest value, V.
South of Clyde, undoubtedly, we get more into the great groove
of migration which crosses Scotland from the Firth of Forth,
and if not yet so heavy as, for instance, at the Bell Rock,
Isle of May, in all the years till 1884, yet we have more
decided indications of rushes and throbs keeping time with
the East Coast movements. When to this we add a less
indented coast line, open lights, and, on the whole, greater
power and brilliancy, we expect to find all the conditions more
favourable. That this is the case our schedules for 1884 show
decidedly, and even swamp the East Coast returns for the first
time in our experience. When we come to the Isle of Man,
where the Irish Channel contracts considerably, we again find
heavy rushes of birds, equalling or exceeding those at such
stations as Skerryvore and Dhuheartach and Rhinns of Islay.
Of these Langness sends the heaviest returns, but we have there
now a trained reporter, Mr. Robert Clyne, who was previously
under Mr. Agnew at the Isle of May. Mr. Clyne's eager application
to the subject now stands us in good stead.</p>

<p>The reason in 1884 for the contrary of the usual rule, <i>viz.</i>,
that East Coast stations of Isle of May and Bell Rock usually
giving heavier returns than the West Coast stations S. of Clyde, is
not far to seek for. The heaviest rushes at Isle of Man, and all
down the West Coast S. of Clyde, occurred between the 15th to
21st and 26th October (see under <a href="#Chickens_Rock">Chickens Rock</a> especially),
while at Isle of May, Firth of Forth, no great movements of birds
were visible. The winds on East Coast of Scotland were N. and
E., and rarely W., but at Isle of Man and West Coast southerly
and westerly. The migration on East Coast was pressed down
on to the East English Coast by northerly winds. But on the
West Coast birds travelled with light arid most favourable winds,
concentrating their forces at the central and commanding
stations of the Isle of Man. We regret we have no returns
from the other Isle of Man stations. I hope the men are not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">- 95 -</span>
disheartened by the non-appearance for two years of the West
Coast of England Report which was entrusted to Mr. Philip M.
Kermode. We earnestly hope they will now continue to send
in schedules, the Isle of Man stations being most important.</p>

<p>The rapid increase of the Stock Dove in South and Central
Scotland is very remarkable. They appeared commonly in
East Stirlingshire in 1884-85, and have been nesting for some
years in the Vale of Menteith, one of the high roads of migration.
Many crossed the North Sea this past season to the East English
coasts. Migration undoubtedly has a great influence upon
extension of range, and the process seems easy to trace out;
and it is very interesting also to find a similar extension of the
Stock Dove to the rabbit-burrows of the sandy coast of Moray of
late years (<i>auct.</i> Rev. Dr. Gordon and Capt. Dunbar Brander).</p>

<p>It appears useful in this place to speak of the comparative
numbers of Woodcocks in the past six years. At the conclusion
of our General Remarks on the last Report (1883) we called
attention to the unusually large movement of Woodcocks, and to
the area which appeared to have been principally selected by
them before their final departure for N. Europe. As mentioned
already (Report 1883), we had very few indications of their
passage over Isle of May or East Coast lighthouse stations; and
all stations returning any mark them as "rare" (see Report,
1882) or "rare in spring." Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock and
Isle of May in six years have only recorded amongst them an
infinitesimal number of spring records, and almost always with
the remark "rare."</p>

<p>In 1879, which was a good Woodcock year in Scotland, we
have not a single lighthouse record from either W. or E. Coasts.
Yet I saw nineteen killed one day near here. In 1880, no
records. In 1881, no spring records and scarce in autumn.
Records at Butt of Lewis, Skerryvore and Lismore. Earliest,
Oct. 28th. In 1882, a few spring records, one at Isle of May,
April 9th ("not remembered before at this season," J. A.)
Considerable and steady records, however, in autumn at five
stations, north of Pentland Skerries inclusive, and at Isle of
May. Rush Oct. 20th (twenty shot at Isle of May). In 1883,
one record in spring at Bell Rock, April 7th, and rare in autumn;
none till October, when a few at Monach Isle, Dhuheartach,
Lismore, Loch Ryan, and in November at Kyleakin and Lismore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">- 96 -</span>
all between 29th and 31st Oct., indicating a rush. In 1884, which
was a good Woodcock season on shore, with immense spring
returns visible between Firths of Forth and Clyde, yet only two
spring records at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May, April 3rd
and March 30th respectively. In autumn, near this, one day I
saw eighteen Woodcocks killed. The similarity of circumstances
of 1879 and 1880 are worth attention. A considerable number
of Woodcocks were killed in October and November, 1884, at
Isle of May, and indications of arrivals very general. The
spring records must have been weakly birds (one was disabled),
as they appeared long after the spring return rush, great
numbers being observable on land on 8th, 9th, 10th to 12th
March. Indeed it would almost appear that any records sent
from Island- or East-Coast stations during spring were of
probably maimed or weakly birds, or birds delayed long after
the "return of the Woodcocks" in March. As before remarked,
the spring birds were all small russet cocks, and they rested 9th,
10th, 11th and 12th March between Firths of Forth and
Clyde, "lifted" again, and did not alight till they had
crossed the German Ocean (see 1883 Report, pp. 80, 81). The
autumn rush was considerably later than usual in 1884 (see
details).</p>

<p>Regarding the unusually extensive migration of Gulls to
our coasts in 1884-85, several suggestions as to the influencing
causes are readily at hand, but the following appears to have
the greatest weight and importance.</p>

<p>As we are informed in 'Nature,' of Feb. 12th, 1885, recent
Norwegian explorations in the Spitzbergen seas show that the
year 1884 was a very remarkable ice year. "The west side
of Spitzbergen was blocked by a belt of land ice the whole
summer through, whilst the east side, which is nearly always
blocked with ice, was more open than it had been for many
years. These conditions, there seems little doubt, depend on
the prevailing direction of the winds."</p>

<p>Now, the temperature of water having been lowered by the
accumulation of ice along the W. coast of Spitzbergen, which is
comparatively approximate to the furthest N.E. influence of the
Gulf Stream, it seems natural to suppose that a deflection of the
branch of the Gulf Stream, caused by the colder Arctic ice and
current, the accumulation of which former was caused by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">- 97 -</span>
prevailing N. and E. winds on the Arctic Seas, would reach
round past the S. end of Spitzbergen to the East Coast, and
would cause the unusually open sea there. But the main
channel of the Gulf Stream would still be towards the S.W., and
would afford the natural outlet for all manner of ocean life,
which requires certain temperatures; and which, such as
Entomostraca, Copepods, Molluscan larv&aelig;, &amp;c., afford food
to other higher organisms.</p>

<p>The great quantity of such food which in ordinary summers
and autumns accumulate around the shores of Spitzbergen, or in
the warm shallow summer seas off the N. coast of Europe, no
doubt retire to deeper water on the approach of winter. In
unusually cold seasons the retreat is continued, following the
course of the milder Gulf Stream until more temperate seas
are reached.</p>

<p>In the course of its retreat it is discovered by vast shoals of
fish, which pursue these minute forms of life even to the
uttermost limits of its possible extension, up certain firths arid
inlets of our East Coast of Scotland. Naturally also the last
link of the migratory chain is taken up by the enormous population
of Gulls and other species of sea-fowl, as we know has been
the case in the winter of 1884-5 in the Firth of Forth.</p>

<p>In the log of the steam whaler 'Eclipse,' Captain D. Gray
(see Report, <i>antea</i>, <a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a>) in summer, repeated mention is made
of the unusual abundance of "whale food" in the Spitzbergen
seas, and I am indebted also to Captain Gray, through Mr.
Thomas Southwell, of Norwich, for a return of sea-temperatures
of the same seas.</p>

<p>Mr. Hugh R. Milne, of the Marine Station at Granton, sends
me some temperatures taken from the Firth of Forth, extending
over June, 1884, to January, 1885, taken at three points, <i>viz.</i>,
Isle of May, Queensferry, and near Alloa. These data, in
connection with the vast swarms of sprats or garvies (<i>Clupea
sprattus</i>) and the attendant thousands of Gulls, are useful for
future comparisons, and I append them here. It would be
interesting to know similarly taken temperatures of the Tay
Estuary, which was completely deserted this season by these
migratory fish, and consequently by the birds also. If we had
also means of knowing the temperatures of the Firth of Forth in
1872-73, when a similar vast migration of Sprats and Gulls was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">- 98 -</span>
witnessed, such data would assuredly lead to most interesting,
useful, and scientific results.</p>

<p>One great difference in the migration of Gulls in 1884-5 from
that of 1872-3 is that in 1884-5 there were very few Glaucous
Gulls (<i>Larus glaucus</i>) or Iceland Gulls (<i>L. islandicus</i>), but in
1872-3 both these species were in vast numbers, comparatively
speaking. It seems to me possible that the 1872-3 migration
indicated by these Arctic Gulls was of even wider and more
extensive influence than that of 1884-5. But of course there is
room here for still further elucidation and collection of statistics.</p>

<p>Again, while the Tay usually is visited by sprats in great
sprat seasons, equally, or nearly so, with the Forth, and was so
visited in 1872-3 though not to the extent that the Forth was,
in 1884-5 it appears to have been almost utterly deserted by
fish and bird alike. The cause was, no doubt, comparative
scarcity of entomostracan life, dependent, most likely, upon
certain undefined conditions of sea-temperatures, affected, possibly,
from the river-basin of Tay and its tributaries. If light
can be thrown upon these not-difficult-to-ascertain data, in a
few years, at most, much of our uncertainty as to causes and
effects of migration of Entomostraca, Sea-fish, and even Salmon
and migratory Salmonid&aelig; will be removed.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The figures in brackets were not observed, but are
entered hypothetically.</p>

<p>Mr. Milne, in writing to me, adds, "I believe that in hot
summer days the temperature at Alloa would be 70&deg; or more,
and during severe winter weather would certainly be down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">- 99 -</span>
to 32&deg;. My belief is that in October and April the temperature
is uniform all over the Firth, and from April till
October it is higher at Alloa than at the Isle of May, the
difference attaining a maximum between July and August.
From October to April it is lower at Alloa than at the May, the
difference attaining a maximum about the end of the year. The
maximum difference between the two places will be about 10&deg; or
12&deg;, giving a rate of change of 0&deg; 2&#8242; per mile." Suspended
matter taken in ten samples at Kincardine on Forth varied from
5 to 20 grains per gallon, averaging about 10 grains.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;It was at Kincardine on Forth, the narrowest part of
the Firth, between Alloa and Borrowstoness, that the greatest
quantities of sprats were taken.</p>

<p>I personally visited Kincardine several times both in 1872-3
and 1884-5, and witnessed the extraordinary congregation of
Gulls and the myriads of sprats. In 1884-5 one smack anchored
off the pier at Kincardine took 16 tons of garvies (or sprats)
during one tide. There were, in all, some twenty smacks all lying
anchored at this narrow part of the Firth, but all of these were
not fishing with the small meshed nets; some for herrings only.
Hundreds of tons were sold at from 14<i>s.</i> to, latterly, 8<i>s.</i> a ton, and
were spread over the adjoining farm lands for manure. Hundreds
of tons more were sold for making up a compost manure&mdash;being
in themselves considered too rich in phosphates&mdash;to a firm in
Alloa. Hundreds of tons more besprinkled the mud-flats at low
tide, or hung by their gills in festoons along the tangle covered
timbers of the piers. The water itself was alive with them, and
every wave that broke on the lower piers left the piers covered
with glittering garvies. A man with a minnow landing-net
could have caught an indefinite number by sweeping each wave
as it came in.</p>

<p>Mr. J. T. Cunninghame, of the Scottish Marine Zoological
Station, Granton, in reply to inquiries, tells me that "his notes
dating 28th Nov. show that Copepods were very numerous and
varied in the Firth of Forth, as were also Molluscan larv&aelig;." The
temperatures of the water, as will be seen by Mr. Milne's notes
in December and January, 1885, were lower than at any other
time of the year being (38) and 35 near Alloa (and Kincardine)
as compared with 41 and 39 at Queensferry, and 44 and 43 at
Isle of May. By the 17th Nov., as is recorded in our Migration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">- 100 -</span>
Report, garvies are reported as very abundant around the Isle of
May, at which time the temperature at that point was 49&deg; against
47&deg; at Queensferry and 45&deg; at Alloa. These shoals were accompanied
by great numbers of Gulls at Isle of May.</p>

<p>As early as March, 1884, vast numbers of Gulls are reported
to have been fishing off N. Unst in Shetland for many weeks
together, such an assemblage never having been observed before
by the oldest inhabitant.</p>

<p>I feel convinced that a steady and carefully recorded journal
of bird movements will result in very extensive additions to our
knowledge of the natural laws which govern them.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may say that in the course of another year's
work we hope to be able to produce some certain data regarding
this matter of relative conditions of the temperatures of the
Arctic Ocean in 1884-5, and the data already given above, from
inquiries now being made by Mr. Alexander Buchan of the
Scottish Meteorological Society; also the connections between
such data and the migrations of Entomostraca and "whales
food"; also to institute a comparison with similar or dissimilar
conditions in other years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p id="ftnt">Mr. William Evans, a most careful and excellent Field Naturalist, sends
me records of the occurrence of high Arctic birds on the Firth of Forth in
1884. The Grey Plover, Knot, and Bar-tailed Godwit were seen on the 9th
August (which, however, was the first day Mr. Evans visited the shore). The
Sanderling was seen on the 14th August, and the Little Stint on the 20th.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Anticipatory of our 1885 Report, it may interest our readers here to learn
that the spring migration of 1885 has developed still more extraordinary
results, such as the migration of Pied Flycatchers dining the first week in
May, past Pentland Skerries, Isle of May, and other stations; and the
occurrence of such rarities as Ortolan Buntings, Red-backed Shrike, &amp;c., at
Isle of May about the same time. White Wagtails also have been commonly
observed at land-stations. (<i>Vide</i> R. Gray, Esq.)</p>

<p>The best thanks of the Committee are due to the above-named
observers for their painstaking records and valued
aid; and it is an added pleasure to acknowledge assistance
received from several ornithologists, including Messrs. James
Andrews, of Swanage, Dorsetshire; O. V. Aplin, of Banbury
(notes from Barmouth District); W. Duckworth, of Carlisle;
T. E. Kelsall, of Balliol College, Oxford; Rev. H. A. Macpherson,
of Carlisle; and Mr. Arthur Patterson, of Preston. Special
acknowledgment is due to the Rev. H. A. Macpherson for most
hearty and welcome co-operation. The recorder trusts to enlist
further aid from the naturalists of the West of England and
Wales, as it will much enhance the value of the report to
include in it observations made by trained and experienced
ornithologists, from whom alone can be expected notes on critical
and rare species.</p>

<p>In dealing with the mass of information received it has been
thought best to treat of it under the following heads.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I.&mdash;A few General Remarks on the Report.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;Reports on the Migratory-Season of 1884, communicated
by several of the light-keepers and others.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;A Diary of the Principal Migratory Movements, which
gives an idea of the importance of each movement, the area
covered by it, and also indicates the species migrating in
company.</p>

<p>IV.&mdash;A separate Report on each species.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">- 103 -</span></p>


<p id="General_Remarks3" class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">I.&mdash;General Remarks.</span></p>

<p>The great mass of migrants during the past autumn seem to
have passed stations decidedly south of Anglesea. The great
movements appear to have taken place between Oct. 21st and 24th
(inclusive), during which period some dozen species were noted;
and again between Nov. 10th and 14th (inclusive), this being
the most important movement, and applied no less than eighteen
species observed at the lighthouses and lightships alone.</p>

<p>The report embraces notes on some rare or interesting
species, including <i>Motacilla alba</i>, <i>Lanius major</i>, <i>Ampelis garrulus</i>,
<i>Chen albatus</i>, <i>Querquedula circia</i>, <i>Phalaropus hyberboreus</i>,
<i>Machetes pugnax</i>, <i>Hydrochelidon nigra</i>; whilst the scarcity
or entire absence of <i>Passer montanus</i>, <i>Corvus cornix</i>, and
<i>Bernicla brenta</i>, and the presence of <i>Bernicla leucopsis</i>, are of
interest to one accustomed to East Coast observations. The
capture, too, of eight <i>Procellaria pelagica</i> at the South Bishop,
on Oct. 14th, is a noteworthy incident. The lanterns vary not a
little in their death-dealing attractions, those of the Bardsey,
South Bishop, Smalls, Nash (E.), Godrevy, and Eddystone
lighthouses being most seductive, occasionally commanding no
less than two hundred victims in a single night.</p>

<p>To be able to offer opinions, or even to speculate on the
various problems connected with the migration of birds on the
West Coast of England, will require much careful study based
upon reports for some years, and it will be much regretted that
this coast has been neglected for several seasons.</p>

<p>Chief attention should, perhaps, be paid to the relationship
which exists between migration as observed on this coast and
the great land mass of Ireland; thus to enable us, if possible, to
give some indication of the lines of route, if any, taken by both
summer and winter visitors and partial migrants on their
passages to and from that country.</p>

<p>To this end a series of careful observations must and should
be made, and special attention be given by observers to the
direction taken by all migratory birds. This, it is thought, has
not received the attention it deserves, and, as it may add a
special value to the observations made, it is hoped that the
light-keepers (especially those on light-vessels) and others, who
have so very willingly helped in the past, will give attention to
this request.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">II.&mdash;Reports from Stations on the Season.</span></p>

<p><i>Carlisle District</i> (Messrs. Macpherson and Duckworth).&mdash;After
a westerly hurricane on Jan. 26th, land birds (Jackdaw and
Moorhen), as well as Guillemots, Puffins, Gulls, and Sheldrakes
were washed ashore, while Mr. Cook found a large Skua; many
Oystercatchers were observed far inland. February and March
were dull; the usual fowl on the Loughs, including Pintail,
Shovellers, Tufted Duck, and Barnacle Geese, were numerous
during the first half of March, and a large flock were seen; as
also a Goosander in mid-April. The general calm of the first
week of April induced the van of our army of summer visitants
to push on early; but the subsequent prevalence of easterly and
north-easterly winds checked the main body. On the afternoon
of April 29th the wind changed from east to west, and we had an
immense influx of House Martins and other birds on the 30th.
August was fine, and many Waders arrived early; but it appeared
that the chief arrivals took place between the last week this
month and the second week of September. Geese and Ducks
arrived before the middle of October; and the heavy westerly
winds on the 26th and 27th brought ashore the Pomatorhine
Skua and Leach's Petrel. The weather continued chiefly open
until the end of the year, but most Waders had left by the end
of October. In November and December the Geese and Ducks
alone relieved the monotony of the Solway.</p>

<p><i>St. Bees</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>&mdash;Mr. Henry Nott tells me that birds are generally
few, unless Starlings and Lapwings; Starlings have been
exceptionally numerous during the winter; as for Thrushes and
Blackbirds he scarcely ever sees one.</p>

<p><i>Morecambe Bay</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>&mdash;Mr. Henry Clavell informs me that
very few birds have passed this station during the past
two years.</p>

<p><i>Nash</i> (E.) <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> (Mr. Henry Nicholas).&mdash;Birds have not been
noticed in such large flocks as last year. The most decided and
general movement took place between the 2nd and 15th of
November. Wild Ducks have been very scarce this year, and
Sky Larks and Starlings have not been observed in such
immense numbers as in years past.</p>

<p><i>Start</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>&mdash;Mr. William Jones notes that in very few instances
birds are observed at his station.</p>

Nov. 30th, several at 11.30 a.m., passing S.S.E.</p>

<p><i>Linota</i> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. Under the heading of "Linnets" there is the
under-given information. Scarweather <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 17th, 24th, and
29th, flocks at intervals during the daytime. Bardsey <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Sept.
20th, many on the island; Nov. 12th, many at the lantern all night,
with other species. South Stack <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 5th, continuous flocks
between 8 and 9 a.m.; Oct. 18th and 20th, flocks, composed of
Linnets, Finches, and Starlings, between 7 and 10 a.m. South
Bishop <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 14th, many, along with other species, from
11 p.m. to daylight. Milford <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 14th, a few; 23rd and
24th, along with Larks and Starlings. Bull Point <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct.
18th, about forty at 7.30 a.m. Scarweather <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Jan. 4th,
1885, a flock at 10.30 a.m. It is possible that in addition to
<i>Linota cannabina</i>, that <i>flavirostris</i> and even <i>rufescens</i> may be
referred to.</p>

<p><i>Pyrrhula europ&aelig;a</i>, Bullfinch.&mdash;Morecambe Bay <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 21st,
several, in company with Larks, from 10 to 12 a.m., flying
S.S.W.</p>

<p><i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>, Snow Bunting.&mdash;Carlisle District, Nov.
15th, first seen at Rickerby; large flocks on Crossfell same
time; shot a pair of old birds, very white, at Silloth, Dec. 11th;
a flock on Skinburness, same time.</p>

<p><i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>, Starling.&mdash;The very numerous entries of the
movements of this species would furnish quite a voluminous
report in itself, and forms quite a feature of the returns. It is
noted frequently at all the stations making returns, save two,
between Aug. 31st, at Flatholm <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, and Feb. 15th, 1885, at the
South Bishop <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>; often in very considerable numbers, and
both during the daytime and at night, when occasionally many
perish at the lanterns. The number and continuity of the movements
of this species, as observed at some stations, may, in a
measure, be due to its well-known habit of massing in the
autumn and winter. These flocks disperse in the morning,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">- 118 -</span>
when the birds seek their food at varying distances from their
roosting-quarters. They return in the evening, and in doing so
would pass many of the West Coast stations, not a few of which
are situated in estuaries easily crossed. For further details of
the movements of this species consult the diary preceding this
section of the Report.</p>

<p><i>Corvus corone</i>, Crow.&mdash;St. Tudwall's <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 4th, several at
9 a.m., flying W. Carnarvon Bay <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 23rd, a large flock,
passing S. at 8 a.m. South Stack <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, a flock, passing S. at
10 a.m. Selker <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Nov. 10th, one going S. at 2.30 p.m.
Bideford Bar <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Dec. 12th, forty at 7.30 a.m.</p>

<p><i>Corvus cornix</i>, Hooded Crow.&mdash;Merionethshire, one seen
about the end of October. Carlisle District, "a single
straggler" shot, Nov. 14th.</p>

<p><i>Corvus frugilegus</i>, Rook.&mdash;Smalls <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Nov. 7th, seven at
9.30 a.m.; Nov. 8th, a very large flock at 10.30 a.m.
Scarweather <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Nov. 14th, a very large flock at 11 a.m.</p>

<p><i>Alauda arvensis</i>, Sky Lark.&mdash;Under this heading and the
general term of "Lark" there are very numerous entries, most of
which doubtless refer to this species; but experience leads one to
opine that in some instances the Meadow Pipit, or "Titlark,"
may be meant. Recorded from most stations between Sept. 14th
at Eddystone and Feb. 17th, 1885, at the South Bishop. On
Oct. 21st there was a general movement, the species being
observed from the Selker <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> to the Eddystone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> Great
numbers occurred at the Longships <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> on Sept. 29th, at the South
Bishop <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> on Oct. 14th, and on Nov. 4th and 6th at the Smalls
Rock <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> Migrates during the daytime, and rarely at night.
Mr. Hills, of the South Bishop, says that flocks of Larks pass
south, during the daytime, from November until the end of
January.</p>

<p><i>Cypselus apus</i>, Swift.&mdash;Spring: Carlisle District, April 28th,
one flying at a considerable height. Autumn: Carlisle District,

"Falcon Hawks," "sad havoc" with the numerous smaller
species present.</p>

<p><i>Asio accipitrinus</i>, Short-eared Owl.&mdash;Carlisle District, Sept.
6th, one adult female; one in November; strange to say, no
others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accipitres.</span>&mdash;Under the heading of "Hawk" there are the
following records:&mdash;Morecambe Bay <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, May 11th, one flying
E. by S. in the early morning. South Bishop <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 14th,

birds seen.</p>

<p>"Grey Geese."&mdash;Carlisle District, Oct. 10th, large arrival,
most of which passed on. Mr. Macpherson's impression is that
Bean, Pink-footed, and Grey-lag, all occurred during the autumn
and winter; but the only birds shot belonged to the first-named,
<i>A. segetum</i>. Two of these were shot, out of a flock of twenty-five.
Carnarvon Bay <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Jan. 4th, 1885, forty at 10 a.m.,
flying N.N.W.</p>

<p><i>Chen albatus</i>, Snow Goose.&mdash;Carlisle District, Aug. 22nd, one
adult, Allonby, 9 a.m., weather very hazy; flew from west (Irish
Channel?) to east. Followed up all day, to no purpose. Seen
again Sept. 8th and Oct. 14th. It is impossible to shoot Geese
on the Solway in open weather, except at night.</p>

<p><i>Bernicla leucopsis</i>, Barnacle Goose.&mdash;Carlisle District, large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">- 120 -</span>
arrival about Oct. 10th. A flock of considerably more than
a hundred rose off Rockliffe Marsh, and pitched on the Burgh
side, early on Oct. 16th. A flock, estimated at between 600 and
1000 birds, visited Rockliffe in December.</p>

<p><i>Cygnus bewicki</i>, Bewick's Swan.&mdash;Carlisle District, Nov. 23rd,
single bird, Monkhill; sharp frost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Teal. A pair noted at St. Bees on Aug. 24th. The
references to Ducks, at both the Selker and Dee light-vessels,
are very numerous; at the latter "Black Duck" (? Scoters)
were first noted on Sept. 10th. "Ducks" are chronicled from
many stations, but unfortunately without reference to species.</p>

<p><i>Harelda glacialis</i>, Long-tailed Duck.&mdash;Carlisle District,
immature male, Monkhill, Jan. 24th to March 19th.</p>

adult male, Monkhill; others subsequently on Solway.</p>

<p><i>Clangula glaucion</i>, Golden-eye.&mdash;Carlisle District, April 28th,
two old drakes and several others at Monkhill. First, immature,
Oct. 10th; numerous in November.</p>

<p><i>Columba palumbus</i>, "Wood Pigeon."&mdash;Nash (E.) <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct.
12th, one killed against the lantern at 8.45 p.m.; on this night,

District young birds were making for the coast on the 9th of
July.</p>

<p><i>&AElig;gialitis hiaticula</i>, Ringed Plover.&mdash;Carlisle District, Aug.
28th, immense mixed flock of this and Dunlin; about one-third
only were Dunlins; nearly all the Ringed Plover were adults,
and large birds.</p>

<p><i>Eudromias morinellus</i>, Dotterel.&mdash;Carlisle District, one shot,
circa, April 20th; several others shot in the "Lakes" for the fly-dressers,
which is much to be regretted.</p>

</div>


<p>In the spring of 1884 schedules were forwarded to thirty-six
light-stations. Twenty-seven replied by returning the schedules
either partially, or wholly, filled with observations.</p>

<p>In the autumn a similar number of schedules were sent out,
and twenty-six stations replied.</p>

<p>Several stations filled two, and some light-keepers, who took
a special interest in Ornithology, returned as many as three and
four schedules, both in spring and autumn. Observers placed on
isolated rock stations at a distance from the coast, or on light-vessels,
have, as a rule, taken the most interest in the subject of
migration. This is fortunate, as such stations are least influenced
by the local movements of birds on the mainland.</p>

<p>Observations have now been taken on the Irish coast for
three years and a half, during which period a large body of
statistics has been collected. Their value cannot be questioned;
but as the records accumulate the importance of correctly identifying
every species becomes more apparent. To attain this object
the light-keepers were asked to forward the leg and wing of all
birds about which they felt any doubt. Several wings, &amp;c., have
been sent, and a list of them is subsequently given. In future,
it is hoped that the light-keepers will not think it too much
trouble to preserve and label the wings and legs of <i>at least one
specimen of each kind of bird which is killed at their station</i>.
This is very desirable, since it cannot be expected that with so
short experience as they have had the light-keepers would be able
to identify all species beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>With the view of still further attaining accuracy of identification,
a request was made to the Commissioners of Irish Lights
to supply to the Lighthouses some copies of the eight-volume
edition of Morris's 'British Birds.' The Commissioners very
kindly consented to purchase and distribute six copies, and we
are greatly indebted to them for thus placing in the hands of the
light-keepers this useful book, which will at once assist their
observations and relieve the monotony of some lonely stations.
The stations which have received copies of Morris are the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">- 126 -</span>
Tuskar, Tearaght, Rathlin, Innishtrahull, Rockabill, and Coningbeg
Light-ship.</p>

<p>Since the volumes have been distributed in the summer of
1884, some records have appeared in the schedules which are
highly improbable. They appear due to the fact that the bird
seen had some slight resemblance to a rare species figured in
Morris. On the other hand, the coloured figures have been the
means of correcting many errors.</p>

<p>The schedules for 1884 exhibit or emphasize the following
points:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1884 the number of birds has been equal to, and in a few
instances above, the average.</p>

<p>The bulk of the migrants arrive on the southern half of the
east coast of Ireland, and on the easternmost of our southern
counties,&mdash;in other words, along the shore extending from Dublin
to Waterford, and having its limits at Rockabill Lighthouse and
Dungarvan Lighthouse.</p>

<p>A <i>marked</i> migratory movement might be expected in our northeastern
counties between Scotland and Ireland, where the Channel
is narrowest; but we have no evidence that such is the case.</p>

<p>The usual course taken by birds seems to be either N.W. or
S.E. The number of birds which only occur singly and do not
seem to migrate in flocks is large. In such instances it is
difficult to trace the line of migration.</p>

<p>The occurrences now noted of the Greenland Falcon, properly
belong to the same flight that has already been noticed in last
year's Report.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the Snow Bunting is of more frequent
occurrence on our western and northern coasts. A few remained
as late as the first week in May, and it was again seen early in
September, dates which have not hitherto been recorded in
Ireland. Geese were also more numerous on the northern and
western coasts than elsewhere.</p>

<p>A remarkable migration of the Rook was observed at the
Tearaght and Skelligs, both stations being several miles off the
coast of Kerry. It lasted for three weeks, from Nov. 2nd to 20th,
the direction of flight being from west to east. The light-keepers
were puzzled to know where the birds came from, the
nearest land to the west being America. [See general remarks of
light-keepers, and also under Rook].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">- 127 -</span></p>

<p>The greatest immigration of Thrushes occurred between the
14th and 20th of October; Starlings, 18th to 20th October, and the
first fortnight in November; Blackbirds, October 24th; Swallows,
about the 12th May. Whimbrel were more plentiful than usual
at our southern stations when going north in the spring.</p>

<p>The migration of the Starling is perhaps more evident than
that of any other bird; they <i>strike</i> in the greatest numbers.
Woodcocks, on the other hand, usually strike singly; it is
a rare occurrence to have more than one killed on the same
night. Very few birds of any kind strike the lights on the west
coast of Ireland.</p>

<p>Sea-birds scarcely ever strike the lanterns. The instances
are so few of birds striking on clear nights, that they do not
number half a dozen per annum.</p>

<p>Some evidence has been given that the Wren is resident on
the Tearaght, Skelligs, and Eagle Islands, all three very bare and
isolated rocks on the west coast; but the specimens received
differ in no respect from the Common Wren of the mainland.
The Hedgesparrow was also received from the Tearaght, and
several are stated to have remained there during last winter.</p>

<p>An interesting observation was made by Mr. McCarron, of the
Tearaght, who watched an old Razorbill dive beneath its young
one and rise exactly underneath it. The young one was thus
raised on the back of the old bird, which carried it in this
position over the waves in a rough sea. This occurrence was
witnessed several times.</p>

<p>The transfer of the light-keepers from one station to another
is unavoidable, and changes are made by the Commissioners
every year. There are instances in which one might imagine
that the birds had followed the migration of a particular light-keeper,
if he has been a more careful observer than his predecessor
at that station.</p>

<p>We trust the efforts made to enable the birds to be identified
will succeed in time; the various kinds of Gulls are much confused,
and the Puffin, Razorbill, and Guillemot are constantly
doing duty for each other. Redwings, Thrushes, and Fieldfares
are not always distinguished; while Larks, Linnets, and Finches
are perhaps too closely associated in the minds of some light-keepers.
By the production of specimens in future, we trust that
some of these difficulties will be removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">- 128 -</span></p>

<p>The insertion in the schedules of the column for the <i>direction</i>
of flight has, we think, been of advantage.</p>

<p>Single Hawks appear occasionally with rushes of small birds,
perhaps to capture the disabled ones.</p>

<p>There is one record of Bats being seen at Rockabill, around
the light, the first instance of such an occurrence on the Irish
coast.</p>

<p>As our records increase and statistics accumulate, it becomes
the more necessary that the investigation should be continued,
so that results may be confirmed beyond question.</p>

<p>To all the light-keepers who have, again, so kindly given their
time and attention to the subject of migration, we are much
indebted. We feel sure that many are anxious to continue their
observations, and that none who are able will refuse to further
our enquiry.</p>

<p>To the Commissioners of Irish Lights, who have supplied six
copies of Morris's 'British Birds' to the light-keepers, and
subscribed for twenty-four copies of the Report, we are under the
deepest obligations, and it is very encouraging to meet with such
valuable assistance from a Public Board whose co-operation is so
essential to the success of our undertaking.</p>

<p>To Mr. Armstrong, the courteous Secretary to the Commissioners,
and to Captain Boxer, R.N., and to Captain Gallway,
R.N., our thanks are especially due.</p>

<p>The foregoing table does not show the relative <i>numbers</i> of
birds striking; it only exhibits the <i>number of stations</i> at which
each species is reported to have struck. For example, the
Blackbird is reported to have struck the glass at nine stations,
but hundreds did so, and were killed or disabled; the Woodcock
struck at six stations, but only seven birds actually struck, all of
which were killed outright.</p>

<p>Sea-birds rarely strike, and land-birds seem to strike lighthouses
on islands more than on headlands.</p>

<p>The light-keepers having been requested to forward a leg and
wing of every bird which they were not able to identify with
certainty, the following were received:</p>

<p id="General_Remarks4" class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">General Remarks of Light-Keepers.</span></p>

<p><i>Fastnet.</i>&mdash;"Spring: The Gannet does not breed on the rock,
and never did; in fact no bird could build, as the rock is too
small. There has been a great scarcity of birds this spring. No
birds of any description seen in June or to 16th July."&mdash;James
Walsh.</p>

<p><i>Old Head, Kinsale.</i>&mdash;"Spring: I understand from those
fishing off this head that sea-birds arrive on the fishing grounds
from daylight to 10 a.m., always from the eastward. Sky Larks,
Titlarks, two Falcon Hawks, thirty to forty Rock Pigeons, Grey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">- 132 -</span>
Crows, Kittiwake Gulls, Green and Black Cormorants, and Sea-pies,
are resident here. The Puffin arrives about 15th April, and
leaves 15th Aug. Snipe are always to be found near a lake three
miles away, and Curlew, Wild Duck, Coot, and Waterhen are there
all the year. Autumn: Saw one Rook with white wings in a flock.
Birds very scarce. Not one Golden Plover seen. No bird struck
the lantern."&mdash;Martin Kennedy.</p>

<p><i>Mine Head.</i>&mdash;No reply.</p>

<p><i>Coningbeg Light-ship.</i>&mdash;"Spring: Great flocks of Puffins pass
almost daily in the summer months from the Saltee Islands,
where they breed, going off during the day and returning in the
early morning [? R. M. B.] about sunrise. Several species of
Gull fly off during the day and return in the evening to the
rocks. No Gannets frequent the Saltees, but Cormorants in great
numbers."&mdash;Patrick Cullen.</p>

<p><i>Tuskar Rock.</i>&mdash;"Spring: No birds seen in January but sea-fowl.
A remarkable absence of sea-birds this year. March 25th
was the last day I saw Divers; they generally return in Oct.
The young or Black Gannet have come since the 1st June in
small numbers, accompanied by some white ones. Autumn: I
have received the eight volumes of Morris' 'British Birds,' and am
sorry to say that all birds heretofore entered as 'Titmice' were
probably Willow or other warblers, and 'Titlarks' were Rock
Pipits. Most of the small land-birds rest on the rock for about
five minutes before flying to shore (seven miles distant). I enter
no sea-birds, as they mostly come and go with fish."&mdash;Richard
Hamilton and Patrick D'Arcy.</p>

<p><i>Howth Baily.</i>&mdash;"Spring: No birds observed migrating.
Gulls and Puffins in vicinity nearly always."&mdash;William Dunne.</p>

<p><i>Rockabill.</i>&mdash;"July 14th. Bats about light all night. Wind
light, S.W."&mdash;Joseph Hammond.</p>

<p>[This is the first entry of Bats since the observation
commenced on Irish coast in 1881. Rockabill is five miles from
shore on the Dublin coast.&mdash;R. M. B.]</p>

<p><i>South Maidens.</i>&mdash;"From 1st to 25th March no birds seen
except Seagulls. It is remarkable how few of the birds seen here
strike the lantern glass. From the 30th March to the 23rd April
no birds seen here but the Solan Goose and Seagulls, the former
coming from the direction of Ailsa Craig. During December
there were scarcely any land-birds. The birds commonly found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">- 133 -</span>
dead after striking the lantern are Blackbirds, Curlew Larks, and
Thrushes."&mdash;Michael Barry.</p>

<p>[There is no entry of either a Blackbird or Curlew having
been killed at South Maidens in 1884.&mdash;R. M. B.]</p>

<p><i>Rathlin Island.</i>&mdash;"Spring: Birds were not at all numerous
this season."&mdash;John A. Murray.</p>

<p><i>Innishtrahull.</i>&mdash;"Spring: The following birds breed on this
island:&mdash;Titlarks, Sandlarks, Stonechickers (Wheatears), Grey
Crows, and Pigeons. On the out rocks, Seapies and Gulls; and
Cormorants on a rock six miles away."&mdash;W. H. James.</p>

<p><i>Dunree Head.</i>&mdash;"Spring: No birds struck the light for the
past six years. I have never been at a station so scarce of birds
of every description."&mdash;John Stapleton.</p>

<p><i>Tory Island.</i>&mdash;"Spring: Sea-birds first visit this island about
15th April for breeding, <i>i.e.</i>, Guillemots, Gulls, Cormorant,
Puffin, Razorbill, and Green Cormorant. Birds of all kinds
scarce this year. No birds struck lantern."&mdash;T. H. Sweeny and
R. C. Duffy.</p>

<p><i>Killybegs.</i>&mdash;"A very poor station for birds."&mdash;Joseph
Hill.</p>

<p><i>Eagle Island, East.</i>&mdash;"The grass on this island is short and
stunted, and not sufficiently long to afford cover or shelter for
birds. I have not seen or heard any birds strike the lantern.
No night migration was observable on this island. There is not
a bush or hedgerow within forty miles."&mdash;Daniel Hawkins.</p>

<p><i>Blacksod.</i>&mdash;"Very few birds to be seen here. No birds strike
the lantern glass."&mdash;Robert W. Redmond.</p>

<p><i>Clare Island.</i>&mdash;"The birds came to breed in the cliffs a
couple of weeks earlier than usual. From April 20th to end of
month, large numbers of sea-birds continually arrived to breed.
The sea-birds that hatched this summer were very numerous.
They will all be taking their departure by the end of August.
During October few birds inhabit the island, except Grouse,
Curlew, Wild Pigeon, Snipe, and a few Woodcocks and
Cormorants; and round the rocks a few Great Northern Divers.
The Eagles did great destruction, killing geese and hens. There
are a great number of Seals in the caves. A boat and crew
killed six large ones in one day in the caves, armed with nothing
but heavy sticks. There are a number of Otters about the cliffs.
In stormy weather they come near the lighthouse. One night in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">- 134 -</span>
Dec. I heard one barking, and saw him go down to the sea
afterwards."&mdash;George H. Brownell.</p>

<p><i>Slyne Head, North.</i>&mdash;"Very few land birds seen this winter.
The sea-fowl are about the island at all times. The number of
birds striking lantern is less than preceding year."&mdash;Robert
Tyrrell.</p>

<p><i>Arran Island, North.</i>&mdash;"During August a great number of
Sandlarks, Sea-pie, Curlew, and Titlarks, remained on island.
Puffins, Gannets, Gulls, and Cormorants flying past occasionally.
Redshanks, Sea-pie, Sandlarks, and Curlew during fine weather
remain on island; when rough they go to the big island of
Arran."&mdash;Thomas Fortune.</p>

<p><i>Straw Island.</i>&mdash;"Spring: The following species were never
so scarce:&mdash;Gulls, Gannets, Puffins, and Sea-pies. I have never
seen so few birds early in spring, but as the spring advanced the
numbers of Linnets, Fieldlarks, Stonechats, and Yellowhammers
increased so much that I have not seen such numbers for many
years past. The different species of Gull and Cormorant
remain throughout the year; they breed on the cliffs on the
large island of Arran. No birds ever strike this lantern, the
light being red, and not showing in the direction of the general
flight of birds. Autumn: I have noticed fewer birds than usual.
The Cormorant, White-backed Gull, and Royal Gull are the only
species remaining during the winter. A number of small birds,
such as Thrushes, Blackbirds, Starling, Linnets, &amp;c., frequently
fly from the mainland, especially in severe weather. All through
the autumn to the present (Dec. 30th) I have remarked flights of
wild Duck and Barnacle going N.E."&mdash;Charles Boyle.</p>

<p><i>Tearaght.</i>&mdash;"I heard the Manx Shearwater for the first time
this year on the night of April 10th, but as usual the note
ceased after the moon rose. I have not seen any of the 'Mackerel
Cock' since March 29th. [A specimen of 'Mackerel Cock' sent
Jan., 1885, was a young Razorbill in winter plumage.&mdash;R. M. B.]
Birds remaining on the island on July 31st:&mdash;Sea-parrots, Razorbills,
Guillemots (only a few), Kittiwakes, Royal Gulls, and the large
White Gulls, Stormy Petrels, Sea-pies, Choughs, and Hooded
Crows. Birds remaining Jan. 15th, 1885:&mdash;Razorbills (young),
Kittiwakes (old), <i>Royal Gulls</i>, <i>Herring Gulls</i> (young and old),
<i>Chough</i>, <i>Hooded Crow</i>, <i>Wrens</i>, Titlarks, <i>Rock Pipit</i>, <i>Peregrine
Falcon</i>, <i>Sparrow-Hawk</i>, Mountain Linnet (Twite), Gannets,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">- 135 -</span>
Chaffinch, Greenfinch, Rock Pigeon, and Cormorants. Those in
italics are always here. The Herring Gull was called previously
'large white Gull.' I wish to draw special attention to the
great number of 'Crows' which passed over this island from the
5th to the 25th Nov. They were flying at a height of seven or
eight hundred feet. When passing this island their flight would
become irregular. Some rested for a little while, and a few were
to be seen some days afterwards having a tired appearance."
[I expressed a doubt about the identification of the species to
Mr. McCarron.&mdash;R. M. B.] He then wrote:&mdash;"I was standing
within ten paces of one several minutes, and it had not the
excrescence round the base of bill, and I think I am correct in
saying it was not the Rook." [Neither Mr. More nor myself
have ever seen a freshly killed Irish specimen of the Carrion
Crow. In the 3rd 'Report on Migration,' p. 86, large flights of
Rooks coming from the sea in a S.W. direction are mentioned as
occurring at Blackrock Lighthouse, nine miles off Mayo.&mdash;R. M. B.]</p>

<p><i>Tearaght.</i>&mdash;Jan. 16th, 1885, one passed from E. in front of

height and moved steadily N.E. towards mainland, accompanied
for some distance by three Choughs and a Peregrine Falcon,

came and were shot also. The four birds are at the station
stuffed; they are like the Snow Bunting, but quite black on the
back, with a greenish tinge and white breast. The two birds
arrived after the Snow Buntings had left." [Two of the specimens
alluded to were kindly forwarded by Mr. Williams, and
turned out to be Snow Buntings in almost full summer attire.
The first week in May is very early for the summer plumage to

under Clare Island.&mdash;R. M. B.] I found a nest with one egg on
11th May, and on 11th June it was hatched, the time occupied
being one month. It is in the night-time all the young birds
leave their holes and go to the sea, and once there they are no
more to be seen. I never saw any of them on the wing or on the
water. They never leave the holes until they take their departure,
and then they go tumbling and rolling to the sea. There is no
trace of this first stage of migration to be observed next morning,
except sometimes in their outward course an odd one tumbles
into our yards, where they are found. I was roused up one night
at 2 a.m. by one trying to get up stairs; it was nearly at the top
when I saw it. Puffins left in a great body on Aug. 1st; number

<p><i>Tuskar Rock.</i>&mdash;July 24th, one young Razorbill; first this
year.</p>

<p><i>Rathlin Island.</i>&mdash;April 6th, flocks resting on the sea. Aug.
22nd, Razorbills leaving island.</p>

<p><i>Blackrock, Mayo.</i>&mdash;April 30th, Razorbills all day; wind
fresh, W.</p>

<p><i>Clare Island.</i>&mdash;March 21st, about fifty "Razorbill-puffins";
25th, Puffins (Razorbills?) in large numbers.</p>

<p><i>Tearaght.</i>&mdash;March 23rd, Razorbills arrived. May 7th, came
on island as plentiful as in previous years. About this date
(July 31st) both old and young are mostly gone. During the
past fortnight both old and young could be heard on the water
at night. A few evenings ago I observed a young bird crying on
the water; the old one was soon beside it, both going seaward,
when the old bird made a little dive, and rose exactly under the
young one, so that it was nicely poised on its back. In this way
both headed the waves, and were lost in the distance. On the
following evenings I kept a good look out, and saw several
instances of the same kind; and on no occasion did I observe
the young birds to fall off, though the sea was pretty rough.
Last seen on Aug. 14th. Sept. 16th, two old and two young
appeared, swimming S. Dec. 7th, young Razorbills; wind
W.; very strong, high sea. As many as two or three
hundred may be seen almost every day, especially in stormy
weather. Having procured a specimen of the bird I called a
"Mackerel-cock" (see fifth Report, pp. 89 and 128), I find it is
the young Razorbill. [Specimen sent.&mdash;R. M. B.; shot, 13th,
Jan., 1885.] It comes here every winter, and not a single old
bird is to be found amongst them; nor one of them among the
old birds in summer.</p>

<p><i>Skelligs.</i>&mdash;March 20th, Razorbills first seen on rock. July
20th, noticed young fledged Razorbills leaving rock. Aug. 5th,
all left, with one or two exceptions. Nov. 27th, great numbers
of the "Black-billed Auk"; noticed flights of them for the past
fortnight, flying S., mostly in the afternoon. They left on 2nd
March, 1885, except one or two, seen on 16th inst. They only
come close to the rock in wild weather. In my former report I
called this bird the Razorbill; but it answers the description of
the Black-billed Auk, in the 'Dictionary of British Birds.'
[Doubtless the young Razorbill, which was erroneously regarded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">- 177 -</span>
as a species under the title of "Black-billed Auk" by Colonel
Montagu.&mdash;R. M. B.] December, a great number of "Black-billed

or perhaps previous to it; plentiful on 23rd. Eggs taken on
June 19th. Will lay the third egg if the others are taken.
They are very plentiful this year, but are never seen in the daytime,
but at night continually striking the glass. They are not
very welcome visitors, owing to the blotches of oil they eject on
the glass and balcony. They are so plentiful skimming about
that they often come close to a person's ears. They are to be
heard in every bank, under every rock, and in every crevice. On
dark calm nights the air as well as the rocks and banks is filled
with their music; their hatching is not over until August is well
advanced. Sept. 15th, one (young) caught on balcony. Oct.
11th, one going S.W.; wind N., showery. Nov. 15th, one on
lantern.</p>

<p><i>Skelligs.</i>&mdash;May 25th, heard the Stormy Petrel under the

<p>Mr. Gurney has received a batch of wings from the Leman
and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> off Cromer, taken from birds evidently killed last
autumn; unfortunately they are not dated, so that much of
their value as a record of migration is lost. They include
Willow Wren, Wheatear, Snipe, Jack Snipe, Ring Dotterel,
Robin, Sedge Warbler, Redstart, Fieldfare (three), Thrush,
Blackbird, Titlark (five), Sky Lark, Chaffinch (three), Great
Tit, Goldcrest, Reed Bunting, Wood Pigeon, Woodcock (two),
Starling, Swallow, Martin, Sanderling, Tree Sparrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pied Flycatcher.</span>&mdash;With reference to Mr. J. Harvie Brown's
remarks (see foot-note, <a href="#ftnt">p. 100</a> of Report) on the arrival of Pied
Flycatchers at the Isle of May and Pentland Skerries in the
first week in May, 1885, it is interesting to learn that the same
species is also reported in great numbers from Flamborough and
Spurn at the same period, <i>viz.</i>, the first week in May; it was
also observed in Norfolk on the 9th. At Flamborough, as
Mr. Bailey informed me, a great many came in on the 3rd,
with a N.E. wind, and in company with male Redstarts. At
Spurn, Mr. P. W. Lawton states that it has been more numerous
than he ever before knew it. ('Naturalist,' June 1885, p. 250,

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
